However, ensuring the correctness and security of smart contracts remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling and verifying Ethereum smart contracts’ exception-related vulnerabilities using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). ASMs provide a formal modeling language that enables the precise representation of system behavior and properties. We developed an ASM model of a Solidity smart contract and demonstrated its use on Unhandled Exception vulnerability identification and check contract correctness. Our approach offers a formal framework for smart contract modeling and verification.

	abstract = {The design of secure cache architectures within computer systems primarily aims to mitigate side-channel attacks and minimize the risks of information leakage. However, verifying the effectiveness of secure cache designs introduces numerous challenges. The assessment of cache architecture security in prior research has mainly been based on the evaluators' expertise, which lacks convincing evidence. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a universal and comprehensive formal verification methodology to evaluate the security of cache designs. This paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of an existing formal verification method. Based on this analysis, we introduce an enhanced formal verification method that utilizes noninterference hyperproperties to verify the security of cache architectures.In this paper, an extended triple mutual information formula is utilized to verify the satisfaction of noninterference hyperproperties within cache architectures and identify potential information leakages through three independence conditions. The degree of information leakage is evaluated by measuring the dependencies between the victim's inputs and the attacker's observations through triple mutual information. This paper instantiates existing cache architectures and reveals potential vulnerabilities by formalizing the behavior specification and replacement policy of a cache as an extended abstract state machine. Lastly, the cache security structure is formally validated utilizing the proposed security model, with the aim of evidencing its effectiveness and soundness. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications, which often handle assets of considerable value. While the underlying platforms guarantee the correctness of smart-contract execution, they cannot ensure that the code of a contract is correct. Today, as evidenced by a number of recent security breaches, developers still have a hard time making contracts that work properly.Even though these incidents often exploit contract interaction, prior work on smart-contract verification, vulnerability discovery, and secure development typically considers only individual contracts in isolation. To address this gap, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a abstract state machine based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify the behavior of a set of interacting contracts at a high level of abstraction. VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code that is functionally and behaviorally equivalent to verified models, which enables the creation of correct-by-design smart contracts. We additionally introduce a graphical notation (called deployment diagrams) for specifying possible interactions between contract types. Based on this notation, we present a framework for the automated verification, generation, and deployment of contracts that conform to a deployment diagram. To demonstrate the applicability of VeriSolid, we translate existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) specifications to temporal properties for two of the most popular contract interfaces: ERC20 and ERC721. We also show you how to write code for the ERC20 and ERC721 interfaces in a way that is safe, and we do this by using VeriSolid. We evaluate our framework on 726 contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, which include 267 ERC20 and 459 ERC721 contracts. Our experiments indicate that 18% of ERC20 contracts and 4% of ERC721 contracts fail to satisfy the EIP specifications. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a Trusted Execution Environment technology on ARM processor, TrustZone provides an isolated and independent execution environment for security sensitive programs and data on the device. However, making Trusted OS and all Trusted Applications run in the same trusted environment may cause problems - the exploitation of vulnerabilities on any component will affect the others in the system. Although ARM proposed S-EL2 virtualization technology, which supports multiple isolated partitions in the Security World to alleviate this problem, there may still be security threats such as information leakage between partitions in the actual partition manager. Current secure partition manager designs and implementations lack rigorous mathematical proofs to guarantee the security of isolated partitions. This study analyzes the multiple secure partitions architecture of ARM TrustZone in detail, proposes a refinement-based modeling and security analysis method for multiple secure partitions of TrustZone, and completes the modeling and formal verification of the secure partition manager based on the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. First, a multiple security partitions model named RMTEE is built based on refinement, an abstract state machine is used to describe the system running process and security policy requirements, and the abstract model of multiple secure partitions is established and instantiated. Then the concrete model of the secure partition manager is implemented, in which the event specification is implemented following the FF-A specification. Secondly, in view of the problem that the existing partition manager design cannot meet the goal of information flow security verification, a DAC-based inter-partition communication access control is designed and applied to the modeling and verification of TrustZone security partition manager. Finally, the correctness of the concrete model's refinement of the abstract model and the correctness and security of the event specification in the concrete model are proved, thus completing the formal proof of 137 definitions and 201 lemmas in the model (more than 11,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code). The results show that the model satisfies confidentiality and integrity, and can effectively defend against malicious attacks of partitions. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Using architectural patterns is of paramount importance for guaranteeing the correct functionality, maintainability and modularity, especially for complex software systems. The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern is typically used in user interfaces (UIs), since it allows the separation between the internal representation of the information and the way it is shown to users. The main problem of using this approach in a formal setting, where formal models are used to specify the requirements and prove safety properties, is that those models are not directly used within the MVC pattern and, thus, all the activities performed at model-level are somehow lost when implementing the UI. For this reason, in this paper, we present the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), an extension of the classical MVC where the model is a formal specification, written using Abstract State Machines. This pattern is supported by the AsmetaFMVCLib, which allows the user to link the formal model with the view and the controller by using simple Java annotations. We present the application of fMVC on a simple example of a calculator for explanatory purposes, then we apply it to the AMAN case study, which has inspired the definition of fMVC. We discuss the advantages of fMVC and its shortcomings, trying to identify the scenarios where it should be applied and possible alternatives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Such a strategy is appealing to implement an intelligent machine which foresees multiple time steps instead of predicting step by step. In particular, a flexible sequential learning is developed to directly predict future states without visiting all intermediate states. A Bayesian approach to multi-temporal-difference neural network is accordingly proposed to calculate the stochastic belief state for an abstract state machine so as to capture large-span context as well as make high-level prediction. Importantly, the sequence data are represented by multiple jumpy states with varying temporal differences. A Bayesian state machine is trained by maximizing the variational lower bound of log likelihood of sequence data. A generalized sequence model with various number of Markov states is derived with the simplified realization to the previous temporal-difference variational autoencoder. The predictive states are learned to roll forward with jumps. Experiments show that this approach is substantially trained to predict jumpy states in various types of sequence data. © 2022 J.-T.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology based on formal methods for security verification of cache architectures. Specifically, we design an entropy-based noninterference reasoning framework with two unwinding conditions to assess the information leakage of the cache designs. The reasoning framework quantifies the dependency relationships by the mutual information between the distributions of input and output of side channels. Given a cache design, we formalize its behavior specification along with the cache layouts into an abstract state machine, to instantiate the parameterized reasoning framework that discloses any potential vulnerabilities. We use our methodology to assess eight state-of-the-art cache architectures to demonstrate reliability as well as flexibility. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The problem of workflow scheduling on virtual machines in a cloud environment is to find the near optimal permutation of the assignment of independent computational jobs on a set of machines that satisfies conflicting objectives. This problem is known to be an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary multiobjective algorithms are optimization methods to solve such problems. hypervolume is one of the most important criteria that is used to both as solution evaluation and as a guidance for near-optimal selection of a set of solutions called the Pareto front. In this paper, a new hypervolume-based multiobjective algorithm is proposed for driving the Pareto front. To this end, we extend the single-objective Black hole heuristic algorithm based on the adopted θ-dominance relation to improving the diversity and convergence to an optimal Pareto front. The conflicting objectives are resource utilization, resource cost, and the workflow makespan (completion time). Also to presenting the appropriate scheduling algorithm, we have proven the correctness of the proposed algorithm by providing the behavioral model of the suggested system using model checking tool. For this purpose, we first introduce the behavioral model of the proposed system using Abstract state machine and extract the properties of the algorithm in the form of linear temporal logic. Then we encode the algorithm using the model checker tool Abstract state Machine Meta-model-based Language and verify the accuracy of the algorithm based on the expected properties, reachability, fairness, and deadlock-free. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we: (1) extended the WorkflowSim tools, (2) applied it to both balanced and imbalanced workflows and (3) compared results to algorithms, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm-2, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-2, Multi-Swarm MultiObjective Optimization, Intelligent Water Drops algorithm and Genetic Algorithm and Pareto-based Grey Wolf Optimizer. The comparisons show that by increasing the number of users requests and their correlations, the proposed algorithm can find more optimal Pareto front. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In architecture-based self-adaptation of decentralized systems, design patterns have been introduced to ease the design of complex adaptation solutions that usually require the interaction of different MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) control loops, each dealing with an adaptation concern of the managed system. Such MAPE patterns have been proposed by means of a graphical notation, but without a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of components interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome these limitations. We present a domain-specific language, called MSL for MAPE Specification Language, to define and instantiate MAPE patterns and to give semantics to some semantic variation points of the equivalent graphical notation for MAPE pattern. We also provide a formal semantics of the language by means of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, an extension of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formalism to model self-adaptation. Such semantics definition comes with an automatic transformation of MSL models into formal executable models, and opens to the possibility of performing rigorous analysis (validation w.r.t. the adaptation requirements and verification of adaptation properties) of MSL models. Moreover, we present our current results toward a (long-term) realization of an MSL-centric framework, where MSL is the notation of a modeling front-end, on top of richer and more specific modeling, analysis, and implementation back-end frameworks. As proof of concept of our approach, we show the application of MSL and its formal support to a running case study in the field of home automation, by modeling an adaptive control of a virtual smart home developed with the OpenHAB runtime platform. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Task scheduling in the cloud environment is a critical problem and using a suitable method for task scheduling will increase resource efficiency. This will increase the satisfaction of customers due to providing their QoS requirements. The available solutions to this problem often seek to improve one of the criteria for service quality and use different methods to achieve this goal. This paper is aimed at offering an optimal solution to solve the task scheduling problem in the cloud environment using the firefly algorithm. The proposed algorithm helps not only to reduce the longest task completion time, but also to increase the utilization of virtual machines by taking into account the capabilities of each virtual machine and using the appropriate method for distributing virtual machine requests. Although, finding a proper task scheduling method is desirable, the correctness of this approach that can be checked by the automatic formal verification methods is a challenge. One of the most efficient method in this area is model checking which can verify the behavior of a system by checking some desired properties on the system model. Hence, we define a behavioral model of the task scheduling algorithm based on model checking techniques. To do so, we encode the algorithm to Abstract State Machine Metamodel-based Language (AsmetaL) and then some properties are defined for verifying the algorithm. The results obtained from the implementation of the proposed method show that the proposed method has an acceptable improvement for makespan and resource utilization. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Service-oriented computing is playing an important role in several domains. Today the biggest shift in mainstream design and programming is toward service-oriented applications. However, the service paradigm raises a bundle of problems that did not exist in traditional component-based development where abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity were the only main concerns. Due to their distributed, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature, service-oriented software applications require us to discover, document, and share new design patterns at the service- and architecture-level. Moreover, service-oriented applications are hard to design and validate, and demand for new foundational theories, modeling notations and analysis techniques. In line to such a vision, this article presents a framework, called SCA-PatternBox, to design and prototype service-oriented applications with design patterns. The framework relies on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) and on SCA component implementation types, such as SCA-Java, for supporting an “implementation-oriented” approach to service-oriented architecture modeling and to the definition and instantiation of design patterns. Moreover, in order to provide formally verified design patterns, SCA-PatternBox allows the formal specification and analysis of the functional behavioral aspects of a design pattern using a formal service specification language called SCA-ASM (Service Component Architecture-Abstract State Machine). As major evaluation of the framework, two case studies and lessons learned are presented. A final comparison of existing design pattern languages is also reported. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

A drawback of BPMN, however, is that modality is implicitly expressed through the structure of the process flow but not directly within the corresponding activity. Thus, an extension of BPMN with deontic logic has been proposed in previous work, called Deontic BPMN. Deontic BPMN reduces the structural complexity of the process flow and increases the readability by explicitly highlighting obligatory and permissible activities. In addition, an algebraic graph transformation from a subset of BPMN to Deontic BPMN, called Deontic BpmnGTS, has been defined. The goal of the current research is to show that DeonticBpmnGTS is terminating and confluent, resulting in a globally deterministic transformation. Moreover, the semantic equivalence of BPMN models and the respective Deontic BPMN models is proven based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Thus, DeonticBpmnGTS can be called a trusted model transformation. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A major problem of business process modelling languages that primarily express the flow of activities is the limited support for actor modelling provided by rigid swimlane concepts. Thus, the aim of this work is to present a general approach for actor modelling in business processes that supports different layers of abstraction, thereby increasing the expressiveness and avoiding inaccuracy and redundancy. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed actor modelling approach supports task-based assignment of actors and roles based on deontic logic and speech act theory. The semantics of the approach is formally specified based on abstract state machines. Findings: The new approach for actor modelling is more expressive and provides the possibility to reduce the structural complexity of the process flow as shown by a case study and a comparison of an ordinary business process modelling approach using swimlanes and the actor modelling approach based on the workflow resource patterns. In particular, the evaluation showed that important patterns such as separation of duties and retain familiar are only supported by the actor modelling approach. Research limitations/implications: The research is to some degree in the context of the business process model and notation as a representative of a business process modelling language using swimlanes. Originality/value: Different gradations concerning the extent to which actor modelling is supported make the new approach outstanding for modelling activities, actors, and constraints in an expressive and legible way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {That event driven architecture (EDA) will compliment the data driven systems in future is evident from the current literature. In this paper, the use of event driven architecture (EDA) as a platform for supporting event oriented applications in power control centers is presented. EDA operates on the semantics of events and event patterns, which are easy to decipher, flexible, extensible and conform to the standard. The concept is explained with real-time congestion management procedure recently introduced in Indian power sector. The semantics of events pertaining to real-time congestion management are defined in terms of states and state transitions of an abstract state machine. The state machine is then used to define a minimal set of basic and complex event patterns, which are implemented using an open source event processing tool. The results show that the congestion state of the system is correctly identified, and can be used as decision support. The case study is indicative of a wider set of event oriented applications that can be supported by EDA at control centers and constituents.},

	abstract = {The instruction set architecture (ISA) of a computing machine is the definition of the binary instructions, registers, and memory space visible to an executable binary image. ISAs are typically implemented in hardware as microprocessors, but also in software running on a host processor, i.e. virtual machines (VMs). Despite there being many ISAs in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of robust ISAs by the formal construction of all normal and exception conditions for each instruction. This is a task to which the Event-B (Metayer et al. in Rodin deliverable 3.2 Event-B language, http://rodin.cs.ncl.ac.uk, 2005; Schneider in The B-method an introduction, Palgrave, Basingstoke, 2001) formal notation is well suited. This paper describes a project to use the Rodin tool-set (Abrial in Formal methods and software engineering, Springer, Berlin, 2006) to perform such a process, ultimately producing two variants of the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) ISA (Wright in Abstract state machines, B and Z, Springer, Berlin, 2007; Wright in MIDAS machine specification, Bristol University, http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications, 2009) as VMs. The abstract model is incrementally refined to variant models capable of automatic translation to C source code, which this is compiled to create useable VMs. These are capable of running binary executables compiled from high-level languages such as C (Kernighan and Ritchie in The C programming language, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1988), and compilers targeted to each variant allow demonstration programs to be executed on them.

This paper presents a model-based approach to automatic testing of attack scenarios. An attack testing framework is proposed to model attack scenarios and test the system with respect to the modeled attack scenarios. The techniques adopted in the framework are applicable in general to the systems, where the potential attack scenarios can be modeled in a formalism based on extended abstract state machines. The attack events, i.e., attack test vectors chosen from the attacks happening in real-world are converted to the test driver specific events ready to be tested against the attack signatures. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the most common attack scenarios. The framework is useful to test software with respect to potential attacks which can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Mastermind represents an interdisciplinary research project in computational criminology jointly managed by ICURS and the Software Technology Lab at Simon Fraser University. Using the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in combination with a multiagent based modeling paradigm, we devise a formal framework for semantic modeling and systematic integration of the theories for crime analysis and understanding crime patterns.

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable semantic units that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification.

	abstract = {Finite state machine-derived specifications such as X-Machines, Extended Finite State Machines and Abstract State Machines, are an established means to model software behaviour. They allow for comprehensive testing of an implementation in terms of its intended behaviour. In practice however they are rarely generated and maintained during software development, hence their benefits can rarely be exploited. We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives. The technique has been implemented, which has enabled us to present a small case study of its use with respect to a real software system, along with some preliminary performance results.},

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable "semantic units" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study. © 2007 EDAA.},

Our modeling technique enables an attacker model exactly tailored to the application, instead of only an attacker similar to the Dolev-Yao model. We also introduce a proof technique for security properties of the protocols. Properties are proved in the KIV system using symbolic execution and invariants. Furthermore we describe a graphical notation based on UML diagrams that allows to specify the important parts of the application in a simple way. Our formal approach is exemplified with a small e-commerce application. We use an electronic wallet to demonstrate the ASM-based protocol model and we also show what the proof obligations of some of the security properties look like. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Underlying is the concept of Abstract State Machines (ASM) modeling archival states. Migrations are modeled as sequences of basic operations that change the archive's state while respecting user-defined constraints.

These techniques are significant for design, reasoning and standardization of programming languages, and for design and optimization of compiler as well. They have been widely used in formal description, analysis, verification and design of security protocols. In sharp contrast to the popularity of formal syntax, formal semantic descriptions have seldom been exploited in practical applications concerning design and implementation of programming languages. In this paper, we firstly review the history of development for semantic description frameworks of programming languages. Then we illustrate and assess the features of main frameworks of current interest. Finally, we give the qualitative comparisons of these frameworks distinctly.

	abstract = {Graph transformation is often used to transform domain models from one domain specific language (DSML) to another. In some cases, the DSMLs are based on a formalism that has many implementation variants, such as Statecharts. For instance, it could be necessary to transform iLogix Statechart models into Matlab Stateflow models. The preservation of behavior of the models is crucial in such transformations. Bisimulation has previously been demonstrated as an approach to verifying behavior preservation, and semantic anchoring is an approach to specifying the dynamic semantics of DSMLs. We propose a method to verify behavior preservation, using bisimulation in conjunction with semantic anchoring. We will consider two hypothetical variants of the Statecharts formalism, and specify the operational semantics of each variant by semantic anchoring, using Abstract State Machines as a common semantic framework. We then establish bisimulation properties to verify if the behavior models of the source and target Statechart models are equivalent for a particular execution of the transformation. © 2006 Universitatsbibliothek TU Berlin.},

Supporters for the Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) trend claim its efficiency in terms of rapid prototyping and fast simulation in comparison to the classical RTL-based approach. Intuitively, from a verification point of view, faster simulation induces better coverage results. This is driven by two factors: coverage measurement and simulation guidance. In this paper, we propose to use an abstract model, of the design, written in the Abstract State Machines Language (AsmL), in order to provide an adequate way for measuring the functional coverage. Then, we use this metric in defining the fitness function of a genetic algorithm proposed to improve the simulation efficiency. Finally, we compare our coverage and simulation results to: (1) random simulation at TLM; and (2) the Specman tool of Verisity at RTL.},

Several transaction protocols have been suggested for the transaction management, but they are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity interrupts message exchanges among BPMSs which use different transaction protocols, so that the interoperability among the BPMSs cannot be guaranteed. To solve this problem, this paper suggests a semantics-based protocol for business process transactions. The suggested protocol is composed of the static semantics and the operational semantics. In the context of the static semantics, transaction states and messages are defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In the context of the operational semantics, state transitions of business process transactions are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM). The suggested approach is expected to enhance interoperability among heterogeneous BPMSs, to increase the understandability for the transaction protocols, and to support automatic transaction execution and systematic transaction monitoring. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

In this paper, we present an approach to design and verify SystemC models at the transaction level. We integrate the verification as part of the design flow where we first model both the design and the properties (written in Property Specification language) in Unifed Modeling Language (UML); then, we translate them into an intermediate format modeled with AsmL [language based on Abstract State Machines (ASM)]. The AsmL model is used to generate a finite state machine of the design, including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on the fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be reused to validate the design at lower levels by simulation. For existing SystemC designs, we propose to translate the code back to AsmL in order to apply the same verification approach. At the SystemC level, we also present a genetic algorithm to enhance the assertions coverage. We will ensure the soundness of our approach by proving the correctness of the SystemC-to-AsmL and AsmL-to-SystemC transformations. We illustrate our approach on two case studies including the PCI bus standard and a master/slave generic architecture from the SystemC library. © 2006 IEEE.},

Our approach takes advantage from the ASM language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both a C# code and an FSM representation from an ASM model.

The ways to reach the autonomy are described - high reliability and adaptability of the system, reached by application of Al elements, formal structural models (specification, verification and real time control) and dynamic reconfiguration [1,2,4,9,10,11]. A method using trace models in real time for testing of system operations is described The method is suitable for systems specified by process algebras (CSP - Communicating Sequential Processes [3], Timed CSP [6], ASM - Abstract State Machine [5], and TAM - Temporal Agent Model [7]) where process traces are used The computing processes and these in the hardware are observed. Special control processes (tracers) are specified. They allow to control in real time the correspondence of the real system traces and preliminary computed traces (the formal specification) and send messages to the other subsystems when no correspondence (e.g. to specification and dynamic reconfiguration subsystems). The method allows finding In real time the software and hardware incorrectly functioning (disparity of the traces) based on rigorous mathematical specification. In the paper are described: an autonomous control system structural model, an algorithm for real time traces control, software simulations (laboratory models) of autonomous systems, the faults and reaction of the tracer-processes, all based on CPPCSP - C++ Communicating Sequential Processes library [8]. The application of trace models in real time allows find any system incorrectly operating and this is one of the ways for increasing the onboard computer systems' reliability and to achieve full operation autonomy. © 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Atomicity (or linearizability) is a commonly used consistency criterion for distributed services and objects. Although atomic object implementations are abundant, proving that algorithms achieve atomicity has turned out to be a challenging problem. In this paper, we initiate the study of systematic ways of verifying distributed implementations of atomic objects, beginning with read/write objects (registers). Our general approach is to replace the existing operational reasoning about events and partial orders with assertional reasoning about invariants and simulation relations. To this end, we define an abstract state machine that captures the atomicity property and prove correctness of the object implementations by establishing a simulation mapping between the implementation and the specification automata. We demonstrate the generality of our specification by showing that it is implemented by three different read/write register constructions: the message-passing register emulation of Attiya, Bar-Noy and Dolev, its optimized version based on real time, and the shared memory register construction of Vitanyi and Awerbuch.

	abstract = {Modeling is a popular way of representing the behavior of a system. A very useful type of model in computing is an abstract state machine which describes transitions over first order structures. The general purpose model-based testing tool SpecExplorer (used within Microsoft, also available externally) uses such a model, written in AsmL or Spec#, to perform a search that checks that all reachable states of the model are safe, and also to check conformance of an arbitrary .NET implementation to the model. Spec Explorer provides a variety of ways to cut clown the state space of the model, for instance by finitizing parameter domains or by providing predicate abstraction. It has already found subtle bugs in production software. First order structures and abstract state machines over them are also a useful way to think about cryptographic protocols, since models formulated in these terms arise by natural abstraction from computational cryptography. In this paper we explain this abstraction process, 'experiments as structures', and argue for its faithfulness. We show how the Dolev-Yao intruder model fits into SpecExplorer. In a word, the actions of the Dolev-Yao intruder are the 'controllable' actions of the testing frame-work, whereas the actions of protocol participants are the 'observable' actions of the model. The unsafe states are the states violating say Lowe's security guarantees. Under this view, the general purpose software testing tool quickly finds known attacks, such as Lowe's attack on the Needham-Schroeder protocol. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

However, there are still challenges hindering the wide-scale industrial application of model-based design. One of these unsolved problems is the lack of a practical, effective method for the formal specification of DSML semantics. This problem has negative impact on reusability of DSML-s and analysis tools in domain specific tool chains. To address these issues, we propose a formal well founded methodology with supporting tools to anchor the semantics of DSML-s to precisely defined and validated "semantic units". In our methodology, each of the syntactic and semantic DSML components is defined precisely and completely. The main contribution of our approach is that it moves toward an infrastructure for DSML design that integrates formal methods with practical engineering tools. In this paper we use a mathematical model, Abstract State Machines, a common semantic framework to define the semantic domains of DSML-s. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

Various e-science and e-business use cases are investigated to guide how to create grid systems, and determine which functions grid systems should have. Web services emerge as a standard interoperable technology for grid systems. Although the motivations and goals for service grids are obvious, there is no clear definition for service grids to define and describe the general framework and service access model. In this paper, the general framework for service grids is defined in a formal approach, and the virtual organization based service access mechanism is modeled based on Abstract State Machines (ASM). In the service access model we proposed, the Quality of Service (QoS) issue is considered for the user request.

Despite the complexity and the economic significance of such applications, current practice does not always apply robust and well-understood principles.

Web application development there-fore has potentially the most to gain from adopting such techniques that can offer a greater return on development time and quality factors than traditional approaches. In particular, the paper presents model-driven transformations between platform-independent (conceptual descriptions of Web applications) and platform-specific (Model-View-Controller conformant) models.

	abstract = {Higher-order logic with shallow type class polymorphism is widely used as a specification formalism. Its polymorphic entities (types, operators, axioms) can easily be equipped with a 'naive' semantics defined in terms of collections of instances. However, this semantics has the unpleasant property that while model reduction preserves satisfaction of sentences, model expansion generally does not. In other words, unless further measures are taken, type class polymorphism fails to constitute a proper institution, being only a so-called rps preinstitution; this is unfortunate, as it means that one cannot use institution-independent or heterogeneous structuring languages, proof calculi, and tools with it. Here, we suggest to remedy this problem by modifying the notion of model to include information also about its potential future extensions. Our construction works at a high level of generality in the sense that it provides, for any preinstitution, an institution in which the original preinstitution can be represented. The semantics of polymorphism used in the specification language HASCASL makes use of this result. In fact, HASCASL'S polymorphism is a special case of a general notion of polymorphism in institutions introduced here, and our construction leads to the right notion of semantic consequence when applied to this generic polymorphism. The appropriateness of the construction for other frame-works that share the same problem depends on methodological questions to be decided case by case. In particular, it turns out that our method is apparently unsuitable for observational logics, while it works well with abstract state machine formalisms such as state-based CASL. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

Our approach utilizes an existing embedding of PSL in ASM in order to enable modeling PSL assertions at the ASM level. Here, we propose to compile PSL assertions into C# code, and integrate them with the SystemC design. Assertions are then verified by simulating the new model that combines the original design and the integrated assertions. This enriches the SystemC language with a powerful and expressive assertion specification layer, and improves the verification of SystemC designs by targeting specific properties during simulation. © 2004 IEEE.},

This yields a new verification technique that can deal with the data-width problem by using abstract sorts and uninterpreted functions to represent data value and data operations, respectively. However, in many cases, it may suffer from the non-termination of the state enumeration procedure. This paper presents a novel approach to solving the non-termination problem when the generated set of states, even infinite, represents a structured domain where terms (states) share certain repetitive patterns. The approach is based on the schematization method developed by Chen and Hsiang, namely ρ-terms. Schematization provides a suitable formalism for finitely manipulating infinite sets of terms. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by several examples. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Design space exploration is carried out using the SSEA tool from ETH Zurich/Univ. Paderborn. With the aid of the CHaRy tool from C-LAB a partitioning based on precise timing calculations is carried out. It is closely interconnected to the STARC code generator for StateCharts from C-LAB. It generates code with guaranteed execution times. For processes running as software on programmable processors a dedicated RTOS is generated using the generator TEReCS based on a component library named DreaMS, both from HNI. Processes to be mapped on hardware are handled by the PMOSS tool from TU Dresden/Univ. Tubingen/Univ. Paderborn.

Our goal is to try to find a framework that is based on applied first order logic that permits to represent the verification problem directly, completely and conservatively (as explained in Introduction), and that is apt to describe interesting decidable classes, maybe showing way to feasible algorithms. To achieve this goal we use a first order timed logic that is an extension of a decidable theory of reals with timed functions. This logic permits, on the one hand, to rewrite directly and completely requirements and, on the other hand, to describe executions of various timed algorithms - here we consider block Gurevich abstract state machines because of their theoretical clarity and sufficient expressive power. Then we describe one decidable class of the verification problem that is based on notions reflecting finiteness properties of systems of control. These notions may be of independent interest, as, in particular, they give a way to describe a limited usage of arithmetics preserving decidability that is not covered by existing model-theoretic approaches. As an example we consider the generalized railroad crossing problem that we analyze in its entirety. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This paper focuses on the second aspect. For this purpose, we survey existing approaches for specifying dynamic behavior in related areas of research.

The definitions according to this approach are shown to be more precise and readable. Especially, this approach can be fulfilled by doing a little modification on the current definition. In addition, since ASM is built upon a rigorous mathematical foundation, it is quite feasible to solve the consistency problem for this formal definition by combining formal verification techniques. © 2001 IEEE.},

The methodology is based on ASMs (abstract state machines) as the underlying formal model for describing a processor's behavior. We explain the major advantages of using ASMs and outline the main tool flow from graphical entry of a processor's major RTL building blocks and simulator generation as well as the current status of our project.},

Such transaction protocols typically occur in the context of electronic commerce applications and can be formalized as relational transducers. We introduce a class of powerful relational transducers based on Gurevich's abstract state machines and show that several verification problems related to electronic commerce applications can be solved for these transducers. Our approach is, in some sense, complementary to the approach in [3].},

	abstract = {We present a systematic reconstruction of a compilation method for an extension to logic programming that permits procedure definitions to be given a scope. At a logical level, this possibility is realized by permitting implications to be embedded in goals. Program clauses that appear in the antecedents of such implications may contain variables that are bound by external quantifiers, leading to non-local variables in procedure declarations. In compiling programs in this extended language, there is, therefore, a need to consider the addition to given programs of program clauses that are parameterized by bindings for some of their variables. A proposed approach to dealing with this aspect uses a closure representation for clauses. This representation separates an instance of a clause with parameterized bindings into a skeleton part that is fixed at compile-time and an environment that maintains the part that is dynamically determined. A development of this implementation scheme is provided here by starting with an abstract interpreter for the language and then refining this to arrive at an interpreter that uses the closure representation for clauses. The abstract state machine formalism of Gurevich is used in specifying the interpreters that are of interest at the two different stages. We also justify this refinement by showing that the essential notion of a computation is preserved by the refinement and thus the refinement is a correct one. © Springer Pub. Co.},

The desire to improve performance has resulted in algorithms of considerable sophistication, yet understood by few and prone to errors. In this paper, we illustrate how the methodology of Gurevich Abstract State Machines can elucidate recovery and provide formal rigor to the design of a recovery algorithm. In a series of refinements, we model a recovery algorithm at several levels of abstraction, verifying the correctness of each model. This work suggests that our approach can be applied to more advanced recovery mechanisms. © Springer Pub. Co.},

The verification is based on the reachability analysis of the product machine of the implementation and the specification, both modeled as Abstract State Machines (ASM). Multiway Decision Graphs (MDG) are used to encode both the output and transition relations of the ASMs and of the set of reachable abstract states, allowing implicit abstract state enumeration. Since MDGs avoid model explosion induced by data values, this experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of MDG-based verification as an extension of ROBDD-based approaches.},
