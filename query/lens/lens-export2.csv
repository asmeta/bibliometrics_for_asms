000-010-840-956-873,Rigorous Methods for Software Construction and Analysis - Using abstract state machines for the design of multi-level transaction schedulers,,2009,book,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,03029743; 16113349,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Germany,Markus Kirchberg; Klaus-Dieter Schewe; Jane Zhao,"Multi-level transactions have been suggested as an approach to increase transaction throughput in databases. The central idea is to enable some low-level conflicts to be ignored by taking higher-level application semantics into account. In this paper, we approach the formal specification of a multi-level transaction scheduler using Abstract State Machines. We are particularly interested in showing that concrete protocols for multi-level transaction processing arise as refinements of an abstract ground model specification. Furthermore, we are interested in the proof of desirable properties of such schedulers such as the correctness and if possible also completeness with respect to serialisability, and the recoverability of the accepted schedules. For this we investigate a two-phase locking and a hybrid protocol.",,,65,77,Transaction processing system; Formal specification; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Online transaction processing; Distributed transaction; Computer science; Correctness; Transaction processing; Database transaction,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/borger2009.html#KirchbergSZ09 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-11447-2_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5,,10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5,2170807566,,0,003-535-885-310-778; 006-675-327-793-692; 018-408-105-437-771; 022-955-585-690-019; 026-337-841-416-236; 039-762-238-191-318; 050-309-871-652-59X; 071-992-274-828-236; 078-075-549-814-324; 080-491-897-850-043; 082-391-519-387-578; 088-396-922-427-366; 094-914-877-452-152; 095-581-760-613-083; 097-847-188-441-943; 102-549-976-383-880; 104-030-181-011-305; 106-139-011-778-302; 133-684-460-780-726; 149-813-897-619-176; 185-668-391-346-964; 196-155-916-210-177,4,false,,

SDL is a fairly complex, graphical formal description technique for the development of distributed systems, and has been broadly used in industry for many years. Efforts to define the semantics of SDL-2000 formally have started early in 1998. By now, a draft formal semantics is available, which is determined to become the official formal SDL semantics after its approval in 2000. It is based on the formalism of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which has been selected for several reasons including intelligibility and executability.; ; The formal semantics of SDL addresses the static semantics, transformation rules, and the dynamic semantics. The approach taken to define the dynamic semantics is particularly interesting. Although basically being operational, it differs from existing approaches in several ways. In this paper, we address and highlight some of these differences, using a simplified specification language called SSL instead of SDL. In defining a formal dynamic semantics for SSL, we formally describe an abstract machine, a compilation function mapping SSL specifications to code of this machine, and an operational definition of the set of initial states, using ASM as the underlying formalism. Furthermore, we present in some detail the semantics of SSL procedure calls.",,,242,265,Abstract syntax; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Action semantics; Operational semantics; Programming language; Computational semantics; Specification language; Denotational semantics; Specification and Description Language; Concrete syntax; Computer science; Failure semantics; Semantics of logic; Abstract machine; Well-founded semantics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-44518-8_14 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-44518-8_14.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#EschbachGGP00 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_14,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_14,1555618383,,0,000-427-107-788-225; 000-490-410-327-490; 003-338-696-404-449; 030-266-627-017-428; 036-243-510-363-569; 048-760-252-034-316; 055-995-372-610-402; 067-209-706-756-159; 083-972-922-498-894; 085-253-436-921-134; 088-012-407-050-722; 094-321-717-945-915; 105-620-622-527-144; 108-883-028-829-629; 112-323-824-635-381; 130-690-190-715-810; 131-207-717-577-017; 181-635-026-892-151,25,false,,

Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this paper the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs to capture inferences on rASMs. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete.",,,93,106,Tree (data structure); Reflection (computer graphics); Abstract state machines; Signature (logic); Completeness (order theory); Key (cryptography); Computer science; State (computer science); Representation (mathematics); Theoretical computer science,Abstract state machine; Reflection; Logic; Tree algebra,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_7 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2020.html#ScheweF20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_7,,10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_7,3027906111,,0,000-064-907-303-038; 006-054-288-393-431; 010-262-461-233-214; 018-408-105-437-771; 028-123-482-947-439; 033-092-785-757-554; 045-320-108-551-783; 050-309-871-652-59X; 058-974-031-275-841; 072-130-201-850-819; 081-199-081-360-197; 081-218-440-601-871; 085-098-810-136-199; 089-353-438-562-001; 089-664-162-308-43X; 143-092-503-531-45X; 154-000-910-997-626; 162-759-782-688-733,5,true,,bronze

000-972-292-824-593,An ontological account of flow-control components in BPMN process models,,2017,journal article,Big Data & Information Analytics,23806974,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS),,Xing Tan; Yilan Gu; Jimmy Xiangji Huang,"The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been widely adopted in the recent years as one of the standard languages for visual description of business processes. BPMN however does not include a formal semantics, which is required for formal verification and validation of behaviors of BPMN models. Towards bridging this gap using first-order logic, we in this paper present an ontological/formal account of flow-control components in BPMN, using Situation Calculus and Petri nets. More precisely, we use SCOPE (Situation Calculus Ontology of PEtri nets), developed from our previous work, to formally describe flow-control related basic components (i.e., events, tasks, and gateways) in BPMN as SCOPE-based procedures. These components are first mapped from BPMN onto Petri nets. Our approach differs from other major approaches for assigning semantics to BPMN (e.g., the ones applying communicating sequential processes, or abstract state machines) in the following aspects. Firstly, the approach supports direct application of automated theorem proving for checking theory consistency or verifying dynamical properties of systems.

We use Abstract State Machines (ASM) to describe the decomposition of the merging and splitting behavior of the different BPMN flow node types, such as parallel, exclusive, inclusive and complex, as defined in the BPMN 2.0 standard, resulting in behavior patterns.

However, unlike other well-known and established formalisms, such as Petri nets, they lack of a framework aimed at better supporting their applicability to the formal verification of systems. The goal of my PhD research is to reinforce the ASM formalism as a conceptual tool that developers can find useful and practical in order to analyze properties. 1 Research Objectives Several formalisms have been successfully applied to the development of critical and complex systems in a wide range of application domains, and to their ex-ante and ex-post analysis aimed at verifying and validating functionality and quality issues. Representing the system-under-study at a high level of abstraction allows developers to focus on algorithmic aspects, rather than on specific realizations of solutions at lower levels. Moreover, the mathematical foundation of formal methods provides complete and unambiguous investigations about the behavior and the properties the system-under-study is required to exhibit. In this context, researchers usually distinguish two orthogonal classifications of computationally interesting properties. On one hand, they distinguish between safety properties, which stipulate that “something bad” must never happen, and liveness properties, which state that “something good” must eventually happen, during computation [23]. On the other hand, they distinguish between domainindependent properties, which are interesting for broad classes of systems, and domain-specific, which strictly depends on the specific domain [12]. My PhD research is aimed at moving a first step towards the construction of a framework capable to capture computationally interesting properties within the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formalism [13].",,,1,10,Formal verification; Abstract state machines; Liveness; Rotation formalisms in three dimensions; Petri net; Computer science; Computation; Complex system; Formal methods; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1499/paper1.pdf https://ricerca.uniba.it/handle/11586/143505?mode=full.22,https://ricerca.uniba.it/handle/11586/143505?mode=full.22,,,2396288153,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 022-763-383-134-552; 022-969-892-721-038; 024-439-760-568-187; 024-750-012-894-552; 024-931-694-683-383; 033-203-060-633-211; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-530-929-944-578; 039-095-923-607-223; 041-257-163-032-383; 066-479-700-824-652; 075-511-016-975-837; 085-854-443-964-320; 087-897-547-671-699; 089-375-634-720-529; 092-195-924-604-606; 094-734-717-644-755; 099-345-665-612-630; 105-923-138-582-449; 107-820-588-500-413; 110-568-113-192-118; 113-595-336-847-284; 155-032-984-383-726; 189-521-689-083-502; 193-779-564-524-928,1,false,,

We show that turbo ASMs as defined in [7] allow one to faithfully reflect the common intuitive single-agent understanding of recursion.

This makes it an excellent choice to formally specify and verify micro-architectures. We present a compilation scheme and an implementation of a runtime system supporting efficient execution of ASM.After introducing novel analysis techniques we present optimizations allowing us to eliminate many costly operations.Benchmark results show that our baseline compiler is 2-3 magnitudes faster than other ASM implementations.

The only objection raised to date has been that ASMs are iterative in their nature, whereas many algorithms are naturally recursive. There seems to be an inherent contradiction between the ASM idea of explicit and comprehensive states, and higher level recursion with its hiding of the stack. But consider recursion more closely. When an algorithm A calls an algorithm B, a clone of B is created and this clone becomes a slave of A. This raises the idea of treating recursion as an implicitly multi-agent computation. Slave agents come and go, and the master/slave hierarchy serves as the stack. Building upon this idea, we suggest a definition of recursive ASMs. The implicit use of distributed computing has an important side benefit: it leads naturally to concurrent recursion. In addition, we reduce recursive ASMs to distributed ASMs. If desired, one can view recursive notation as mere abbreviation.",3,4,233,246,Recursion; Stack (mathematics); Abstract state machines; Clone (algebra); Hierarchy; Computer science; Notation; Computation; Abstraction (linguistics); Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/119-recursive-abstract-state-machines/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/119.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jucs/jucs3.html#GurevichS97 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/opera/119.pdf,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/119-recursive-abstract-state-machines/,,,2586045098,,0,,23,true,cc-by-nd,gold
004-479-421-928-118,Modellierung - Modeling with Abstract State Machines: A support for accurate system design and analysis.,,2004,book,,,,,Egon Börger,"We survey applications of the Abstract State Machines (ASM) method for high-level system modeling and for well-documented refinements of abstract models to code. The outstanding feature of the ASM method is that within a single, precise yet simple, conceptual framework it naturally supports and uniformly links the major activities which occur during the typical software life cycle, namely: • requirements capture by constructing satisfactory ground models, i.e. accurate highlevel system blueprints, serving as precise contract and formulated in a language which is understood by all stakeholders (see [Bo03a]), • detailed design by stepwise refinement, bridging the gap between specification and code design by piecemeal, systematically documented detailing of abstract models down to executable code (see [Bo03b]), • validation of models by their simulation, based upon the notion of ASM run and supported by numerous tools to execute ASMs (ASM Workbench [De01], AsmGofer [Sc], C-based XASM [AK01], .NET-executable AsmL engine [Fo01]), • verification of model properties by proof techniques, also tool supported, e.g. by KIV [SA97] or PVS [Do98, GR00] or model checkers [Wi97, DW00, GTW03], • documentation for inspection, reuse and maintenance by providing, through the intermediate models and their analysis, explicit descriptions of the software structure and of the major design decisions. The key to the practicability of ASMs also under industrial constraints is to be found in the simple and intuitive way in which ASMs support defining most general Virtual Machines (VMs) and their refinements to lower levels of abstraction. ASMs naturally extend Finite State Machines by allowing a) states with arbitrarily complex or abstract data structures and b) runs with transitions where multiple components act either simultaneously (synchronous parallellism) or asynchronously (like globally asynchronous, locally synchronous Codesign-FSMs). The flexible ASM refinement notion provides a uniform conceptual framework for effectively relating different system views and aspects, in both design and analysis, filling a gap in the UML framework. The general yet frugal character of the ASM language, namely for a rigorous form of pseudo-code over abstract data, is the source for the flexibility in modeling and analysis which has been experienced in such different areas as: • industrial standardization projects: models for the ISO-Prolog standard [BD90], the ECMA standard for C# [BFGS04], the IEEE-VHDL93 standard [BGM94], the ITUT standard for SDL-2000 [GGP03], • programmming languages: definition and analysis of the semantics and the implementation for the major real-life programmming languages, e.g. SystemC [MRR03], Java and its implementation on the Java Virtual Machine [SSB01], domain-specific languages used at the Union Bank of Switzerland [KST98], etc. • architectural design: verification (e.g. of pipelining schemes [BM97] or of VHDLbased hardware design at Siemens [Sc02, Ch.2]), architecture and compiler coexploration [Te01, TWFT00], • reengineering and design of industrial control systems: software projects at Siemens related to railway [BBC96, BPS00] and mobile telephony network components [CP02], debugger specification at Microsoft [BBG00], • protocols: for authentication, cryptography, cache-coherence, routing-layers for distributed mobile ad hoc networks, group-membership etc., focussed on verification, • verification of compilation schemes and compiler back-ends [BR95, BD96, DGVZ98, SSB01], • modeling e-commerce [AVFY98] and web services [FGV04], • simulation and testing: fire detection system in coal mines [BCF96], simulation of railway scenarios at Siemens [BPS00], implementation of behavioral interface specifications on the .NET platform and conformence test of COM components at Microsoft [BS02], compiler testing [KKP03], test case generation [GR03]. The AsmBook [BS03] introduces into the ASM method and illustrates it by textbook examples, which are extracted from real-life case studies and industrial applications.

As such, they can perform arbitrary actions on arbitrary objects. Abstract State Machines (ASMs) work on a similar basis. Exploring their capabilities with respect to representing and executing S-BPM models strengthens the theoretical foundations of S-BPM, and thus, validity of S-BPM tools. Moreover it enables coherent intertwining of business process modeling with executing of S-BPM representations. In this contribution we introduce the framework and roadmap tackling the exploration of the ASM approach in the context of S-BPM. We also report the major result, namely the implementation of an executable workflow engine with an Abstract State Machine interpreter based on an existing abstract interpreter model for S-BPM (applying the ASM refinement concept).

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of a (self-stabilizing) infrastructure such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system for their execution. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this article, we present our design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler.

Sunderam,"Grid systems and technologies have evolved over nearly a decade; yet, there is still no widely accepted definition for Grids. In particular, the essential attributes that distinguish Grids from other distributed computing environments have not been articulated. Most approaches to definition adopt a static view and consider only the properties and components of, or the applications supported by, Grids. The definition proposed in this paper is based on the runtime semantics of distributed systems. Rather than attempt to simply compare static characteristics of Grids and other distributed computing environments, this paper analyzes operational differences, from the viewpoint of an application executing in both environments. Our definition is expressed formally as an Abstract State Machine that facilitates the analysis of existing Grid systems or the design of new ones with rigor and precision. This new, semantical approach proposes an alternative to the currently accepted models for determining whether or not a distributed system is a Grid.",1,1,9,23,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Rotation formalisms in three dimensions; Semantics (computer science); Grid; Grid system; Computer science; Distributed design patterns; Grid computing; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/grid/grid1.html#NemethS03 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1024011025052 https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1024011025052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1024011025052,,10.1023/a:1024011025052,87709337,,0,005-120-633-292-057; 006-596-961-191-343; 019-956-859-988-442; 029-019-029-147-093; 030-266-627-017-428; 031-683-085-419-45X; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-522-819-489-99X; 053-788-871-662-595; 054-385-648-434-231; 054-440-494-713-631; 060-733-812-776-088; 066-559-566-144-719; 067-518-447-073-108; 070-395-731-610-637; 090-944-664-040-308; 096-701-121-721-360; 100-638-520-723-965; 105-620-622-527-144; 107-902-090-655-580; 112-610-829-932-176; 118-659-199-583-72X; 142-179-624-254-183; 156-248-449-450-930; 159-887-019-171-958; 173-023-089-509-941; 188-072-620-557-602; 197-585-348-881-189,106,false,,

The ISILEIT project aims at the development of a seamless methodology for integrated design, analysis and validation of distributed production control systems. Ensuring the correctness of the design at the earliest stage possible is a major challenge in any software development process. Formal verification is very appealing in this context in addition to simulation and testing, since it implies an exhaustive exploration of all possible behaviours of a system model. This paper presents a proposal of how to use Abstract State Machines to build a series of formal semantics of our specification language, which comprises a subset of SDL and UML. We will further explain, how the use of Abstract State Machines permits model checking at different levels of abstraction, which therefore can be better integrated into the overall design process of distributed production control systems.",,,105,115,Formal verification; Algorithm; Software engineering; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Software development process; Specification language; Computer science; Distributed design patterns; Software development; Formal methods,,,,,,,,,104204800,,0,019-979-551-093-476; 024-867-806-130-203; 031-044-174-897-946; 070-729-942-486-901; 086-911-802-907-518; 095-350-709-430-160; 113-180-475-363-330; 147-101-535-213-234; 181-411-989-710-354,4,false,,

By symbolically executing an ASM specification, certain properties can be checked by transforming the described ASM into a suitable input for model checkers or Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). Due to the rather fast increasing state space, model checking and ATP solutions can lead to inefficient implementations of symbolic execution. More efficient state space and execution performance can be achieved by using a concolic execution approach. In this paper, we describe an improved concolic execution implementation for the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language. We outline the transformation of a symbolically executed ASM specification to a single Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) format.

Nevertheless, computer aided verification of ASM-programs has not yet been well-developed. In this paper we try to shed some light on the limits of automatic verifiability of ASM-programs.; ; We introduce a class of restricted ASM-programs, which are called nullary programs, and provide an algorithm that decides whether a given nullary program satisfies a given correctness property (expressible in a CTL*-like temporal logic) on all inputs. Our decision algorithm runs in Pspace and we show that this is optimal. We also show that straightforward generalizations of nullary programs cannot be verified algorithmically, as some basic verification problems become undecidable.",,,431,442,Formal verification; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; CTL*; Kripke structure; High-level verification; Programming language; Temporal logic; Software; Software verification; Intelligent verification; Computer science; Correctness; Functional verification; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48683-6_37 https://core.ac.uk/display/36468691 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-48683-6_37.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48683-6_37 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cav/cav99.html#Spielmann99,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-48683-6_37,,10.1007/3-540-48683-6_37,1567803624,,0,020-579-587-866-103; 028-326-407-600-726; 045-534-655-339-005; 060-028-923-434-466; 070-770-252-124-940; 070-902-075-491-740; 083-972-922-498-894; 085-050-469-652-225; 105-620-622-527-144; 116-680-276-099-039; 132-339-412-442-251; 156-327-484-857-934; 191-925-997-526-005,54,true,,bronze

That analysis, however, abstracted from details of intra-step computation, and the ASM, produced in the proof of the representation theorem, may and often does explore parts of the state unexplored by the algorithm. We refine the analysis, the axiomatization and the representation theorem. Emulating a step of the given algorithm, the ASM, produced in the proof of the new representation theorem, explores exactly the part of the state explored by the algorithm. That frugality pays off when state exploration is costly. The algorithm may be a high-level specification, and a simple function call on the abstraction level of the algorithm may hide expensive interaction with the environment. Furthermore, the original analysis presumed that state functions are total. Now we allow state functions, including equality, to be partial so that a function call may cause the algorithm as well as the ASM to hang. Since the emulating ASM does not make any superfluous function calls, it hangs only if the algorithm does.",,,140,154,Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Abstraction layer; Representation theorem; Sequential algorithm; State (functional analysis); Computer science; Function (mathematics); State function; Subroutine,,,,,http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/papers/HangingAlgorithms.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/21242861 http://www.math.tau.ac.il/%7Enachumd/papers/HangingAlgorithms.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/csl/csl2010.html#BlassDG10 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/201-Exact-Exploration-and-Hanging-Algorithms.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15205-4_14 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15205-4_14 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/201-exact-exploration-and-hanging-alrgorithms/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15205-4_14.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuri_Gurevich2/publication/221557891_Exact_Exploration_and_Hanging_Algorithms/links/0fcfd5100a3f349cc7000000.pdf https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=101597,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-15205-4_14,,10.1007/978-3-642-15205-4_14,1874813302,,0,000-954-548-403-516; 009-480-071-222-915; 014-414-815-294-109; 014-702-574-281-708; 015-921-188-836-986; 018-408-105-437-771; 021-963-727-792-138; 034-292-361-589-705; 034-400-132-510-675; 034-837-971-496-263; 050-309-871-652-59X; 058-333-645-536-321; 069-050-537-784-263; 077-548-394-049-787; 080-313-281-594-764; 084-663-601-596-132; 085-568-322-618-811; 088-130-131-271-475; 101-084-442-316-559; 105-620-622-527-144; 109-645-547-577-630; 115-830-205-501-718; 118-175-024-682-944; 127-265-490-736-503; 129-601-128-577-741; 131-396-163-070-42X; 145-859-059-004-138; 157-311-554-599-521; 158-389-841-214-563; 160-386-145-954-427; 161-688-856-432-043; 162-442-853-238-997; 177-926-607-492-098; 190-980-070-230-589,10,true,,green

We select the FDS algorithm because it maximizes the amount of resource sharing, and it naturally supports constructs for parallelism. However, timed constructs are not supported. As a result, we propose timed FDS (TFDS) that optimizes over parallel, timed and untimed constructs. In doing so, we make the following four contributions: 1) we extend the definition of control data flow graphs (CDFGs) to define timed CDFGs (TCDFGs), 2) we define a scheduling algorithm for timed constructs called TIME, 3) we extend the definition of mobility used in FDS, and 4) we present optimizations for a composition of parallel, timed and untimed constructs to better aid FDS. We implement our extensions in a high-level synthesis framework based on the abstract state machine formalism, and we generate synthesizable VHDL.

Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service, cost, and value. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, network and communication failures, and misbehavior. The current paper proposes a decision-based solution for the dynamic adaptation part of a middleware which addresses the aforementioned problems for large-scale distributed systems. The envisioned architecture is built on case-based reasoning principles and stands at the base of the adaptation processes that are imperative for ensuring the delivery of high-quality software. The solution is further extended through ground models with a focus on reliability, availability of components, and failure tolerance in terms of abstract state machines. The novelty of the approach resides in making use of formal modeling for one of the emerging problems and introducing an adequate prototype, on top of which one can apply reasoning and verification methods.",,,257,271,Software deployment; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Case-based reasoning; Bridging (programming); Software; Computer science; Business model; Quality of service; Reasoning system,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iccbr/iccbr2017.html#NemesB17 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-61030-6_18 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-61030-6_18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61030-6_18,,10.1007/978-3-319-61030-6_18,2706866006,,0,002-455-691-398-12X; 002-836-163-559-646; 006-633-728-907-907; 011-355-882-727-545; 017-873-730-580-538; 022-174-461-059-506; 023-165-767-211-277; 023-621-481-521-92X; 023-978-956-301-501; 025-447-165-223-578; 026-142-920-167-530; 027-201-204-385-08X; 027-279-351-892-233; 031-950-092-723-576; 032-048-401-909-05X; 036-164-436-495-911; 058-640-297-877-356; 072-710-057-372-680; 085-165-289-676-983; 090-670-977-434-492; 091-352-871-162-401; 096-178-883-052-93X; 104-650-182-214-080; 105-620-622-527-144; 116-002-307-954-577; 132-846-151-769-251; 139-330-264-873-706; 140-555-115-599-662; 147-019-981-692-623; 161-949-193-479-766; 165-182-575-832-582; 182-234-487-844-987; 186-286-712-074-705; 186-599-647-303-221; 198-882-306-100-329,6,false,,

This is largely due to the intricacy of the analog behavioral intent which cannot be captured purely in terms of logic. In this paper we show that by using auxiliary forms of formal specifications such as abstract state machines and real valued functions as references for AMS assertions, it becomes possible to model complex AMS behavioral properties. This approach leverages the growing adoption of AMS behavioral modeling in the industry. The paper also shows that the use of auxiliary state machines allows us to separate out the scope of different analog assertions leading to significant performance gains in the assertion checking overhead.",,,52,57,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Finite-state machine; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Temporal logic; Context (language use); Assertion; Computer science; Behavioral modeling; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://repository.ias.ac.in/101629/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5718777/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5718777/ http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005718777 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/vlsid/vlsid2011.html#MukherjeeD11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/vlsid.2011.27,,10.1109/vlsid.2011.27,2140017391,,0,027-149-052-724-656; 035-513-222-784-888; 053-230-392-967-84X; 054-855-593-773-933; 092-132-423-247-366; 103-856-760-334-269; 131-998-515-292-359; 192-191-233-992-029,5,false,,

It has been shown that MapReduce is an example for the use of the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) bridging model, a model for parallel computation on a fixed set of processors comprising alternating computation and communication phases. In this article we extend the normal execution of MapReduce from processing large finite data sets to processing stream queries with input data stream assumed to continue indefinitely. We classify stream queries into three classes, memoryless, semi-memoryless and memorable, and provide the model for each class using MapReduce based on BSP. In addition, as some stream queries require large amounts of computing sources, the BSP computation model is extended to a model with unbounded many agents, but preserving the barrier synchronization. A behavioral theory is developed for this model extending the behavioral theory of the BSP model. This comprises an axiomatization, the definition of Infinite-Agent BSP abstract state machines (Inf-Ag-BSP-ASM) and the proof that such ASMs capture the unbounded synchronized computations. Finally, we show how MapReduce processing can be further improved on grounds of the unbounded extension.",,,3,16,Synchronization (computer science); Abstract state machines; Bulk synchronous parallel; Parallel computing; Set (abstract data type); Bridging model; Extension (predicate logic); Data stream; Computer science; Computation,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-77543-8_1.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_1 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_1 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_1,,10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_1,3164642705,,0,010-281-068-234-169; 034-400-132-510-675; 037-770-743-869-342; 039-449-793-715-298; 040-160-680-572-188; 041-833-409-225-349; 042-151-895-979-653; 049-856-277-863-084; 058-974-031-275-841; 070-392-289-174-735; 074-708-595-729-042; 082-603-254-960-069; 092-195-924-604-606; 098-131-153-188-936; 113-740-395-634-754; 119-715-529-129-352,0,false,,

Realistic situation analysis scenarios routinely deal with situations involving multiple mobile agents reacting to discrete events distributed in space and time. SADS system engineering practices call for systematic formal modeling approaches to manage complexity through modularization, refinement and validation of abstract models. We explore here SADS system design based on ASM modeling techniques paired with CoreASM tool support to facilitate analysis of the problem space and reasoning about design decisions and conformance criteria so as to ensure they are properly established and well understood prior to building the system. We provide an extension to CoreASM for the Marine Safety & Security domain, specifically for capturing rendezvous scenarios. The extension yields the necessary background concepts, such as mobile sensors and shipping lanes, and offers runtime visualization of simulation runs together with an analyzer to measure success of various rendezvous detection strategies used in the model.

Lee; Haiyang Zheng,"Hybrid systems are heterogeneous systems that include continuous-time (CT) subsystems interacting with discrete-event (DE) subsystems. They are effective models for physical systems interacting with software or experiencing discrete mode changes. ; This dissertation discusses an interpretation of hybrid systems as executable programs written in a programming language with a hybrid system semantics. The semantic properties of such a programming language affect our ability to understand, execute, and analyze a hybrid system model. This dissertation focuses on a few semantic issues that come in defining such a programming language, such as the interpretation of discontinuities in CT signals and simultaneous discrete events in DE signals, liveness property, and the consequences of numerical ODE solver techniques. ; The interactions between CT and DE subsystems and between DE subsystems themselves are captured by discontinuities in continuous-time signals and simultaneous discrete events in discrete-event signals. In order to precisely represent them in compute execution results, a two-dimension domain, called ""super-dense time,"" is used as the domain for defining signals. This domain allows a signal to have multiple values at the same time point while keeping the values ordered. ; CT and DE subsystems are modeled as actors, which are functions that map a set of signals to another set of signals. In this way, a hybrid system model is just a network of actors interacting via signals. We can always transform a network of actors into a composite actor with feedback, where the function of the composition actor is the composition of functions of the component actors. The least fixed point solution to the function of the composite actor, which is a set of signals, gives the denotational semantics of the hybrid system model. ; The operational semantics takes the denotational semantics as a mathematical foundation and defines a set of rules for evaluating actors such that the least fixed point solution can be constructed. Rather than constructing the whole signals, the operational semantics only computes a discrete subset of the signals called a discrete representation of the signals. The constructive procedure is formalized with the Abstract State Machine semantics, where a hybrid system is treated as a state transition system and the rules specify how state transformations are performed. ; This operational semantics supports heterogeneous and hierarchical composition of different models of computation, such as CT, DE, finite state machines, and synchronous languages, and modular execution of the composition as a whole. This ability makes it easy to jointly model and design software controlled systems. ; The operational semantics proposed in this dissertation has been implemented in HyVisual, which is a software tool for modeling and simulating hybrid systems.

We focus on the sensing problem, the question of whether the heart has produced a spontaneous heartbeat or not. This question is plagued by uncertainties arising from the often unpredictable environment that a real pacemaker finds itself in. We develop a time domain tracking approach to this problem, as a complement to the usual frequency domain approach most frequently used.

Eickerling; Uwe Glässer; Bernd Kleinjohann; Franz J. Rammig; Wolfgang Thronicke,"IP-based hardware design became an important topic during the past years. There is an even older tradition of reuse of software components. In this contribution we try to address some key problems of software reuse. First of all, in a bottom-up approach we study some underlying communication techniques used to couple different software components. As the most general solution of this problem is CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) from our point of view, this technique is discussed briefly. From the bottom we move directly to the top. The most flexible way of handling reusable software IP is to deal with their abstract model. Following this approach, modules can be embedded to various target environments using standard synthesis methods. The problem of protecting property in this approach is not discussed in this chapter. We concentrate on how to combine modules that have been modelled in various languages. At least when using a language coupling approach strict support to define bridging semantics has to be provided. A very useful means for this purpose is given by the ASM (Abstract State Machine) method, which is shortly introduced in the chapter. When software IP has to be used this IP resides on various databases in most cases. We discuss, how design workflows can be defined that allow to access such remote IPs. The exchange format XML plays an important role in this context. Finally we discuss an application example: the application-specific synthesis of real-time operating systems (RTOS) and real-time communication systems (RCOS) from a library of reusable and highly generic software modules.",,,47,64,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Embedded software; Component-based software engineering; Reuse; Software; Real-time operating system; Computer science; Common Object Request Broker Architecture; XML,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4757-3275-7_4.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3275-7_4 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3275-7_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-3275-7_4,,10.1007/978-1-4757-3275-7_4,2149499833,,0,048-996-865-323-568; 055-995-372-610-402; 065-074-981-051-374; 065-907-627-832-876; 071-920-723-633-272; 076-073-572-022-016; 076-495-572-011-237; 112-323-824-635-381; 115-484-064-693-373; 120-767-106-495-115; 131-684-231-817-967; 171-140-957-405-705; 184-840-505-117-496; 191-925-997-526-005,2,false,,

The first one is based on the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), the de facto standard executable language for specifying actions within business processes with Web services. The second one is based on the SCA-ASM, a lightweight formal language for modeling service-oriented applications, which is based on the OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method abstract state machines (ASMs) for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way.

Today the biggest shift in mainstream design and programming is toward service-oriented applications. However, the service paradigm raises a bundle of problems that did not exist in traditional component-based development where abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity were the only main concerns. Due to their distributed, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature, service-oriented software applications require us to discover, document, and share new design patterns at the service- and architecture-level. Moreover, service-oriented applications are hard to design and validate, and demand for new foundational theories, modeling notations and analysis techniques.In line to such a vision, this article presents a framework, called SCA-PatternBox, to design and prototype service-oriented applications with design patterns. The framework relies on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) and on SCA component implementation types, such as SCA-Java, for supporting an ""implementation-oriented"" approach to service-oriented architecture modeling and to the definition and instantiation of design patterns. Moreover, in order to provide formally verified design patterns, SCA-PatternBox allows the formal specification and analysis of the functional behavioral aspects of a design pattern using a formal service specification language called SCA-ASM (Service Component Architecture-Abstract State Machine). As major evaluation of the framework, two case studies and lessons learned are presented. A final comparison of existing design pattern languages is also reported. HighlightsThe framework SCA-PatternBox for prototyping service applications is presented.The framework allows template-based definition and use of service design patterns.The framework relies on the OASIS standard SCA for service modeling/implementation.The framework allows formal specification and analysis of design patterns in SCA-ASM.The framework provides off-the-shelf formally verified SOA design patterns.The framework is compared with existing design pattern languages.",46,,140,166,Formal specification; Software design pattern; Structural pattern; Programming language; Specification language; Service Component Architecture; Computer science; Distributed design patterns; Interaction design pattern; Service design,service modeling and prototyping; design pattern languages; service component architectures; formal pattern specification,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/cl/cl46.html#CapelliS16 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/77374 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477842415300440,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cl.2016.07.001,,10.1016/j.cl.2016.07.001,2474982412,,0,001-740-372-457-256; 001-909-417-542-122; 010-836-737-785-491; 012-386-846-404-317; 012-743-423-146-830; 019-508-820-855-627; 021-335-275-892-404; 022-787-676-853-450; 023-314-559-848-982; 029-864-238-862-833; 031-884-068-227-481; 033-825-878-944-178; 033-970-130-900-328; 036-293-781-463-794; 040-736-326-793-892; 046-838-597-306-588; 049-275-455-480-946; 071-518-832-129-387; 074-120-060-567-887; 082-443-801-084-724; 085-278-493-726-942; 106-601-596-984-706; 132-868-621-530-93X; 134-473-833-888-163; 158-403-173-954-58X; 181-401-889-710-788; 181-966-275-784-588; 189-521-689-083-502; 189-603-730-428-63X; 190-994-609-820-310,5,true,,green

This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of these classes of algorithms. In Part I (Interactive Small-Step Algorithms I: Axiomatization), the axiomatization was extended to cover interactive small-step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary. This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment's replies but also the order in which the replies were received. In order to prove the thesis for algorithms of this generality, we extend here the definition of abstract state machines to incorporate explicit attention to the relative timing of replies and to the possible absence of replies.

Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users' requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service and costs. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, failures and misbehavior. The role of the monitoring and adaptation components is essential in understanding failures of the system and reconfiguring it to a stable state based on the available information. We propose in this paper a distributed monitoring and adaptation solution responsible for identifying failures of the components and building recovery plans.

It provides an economically applicable verification technology, and supports the entire design process from formal specifications to executable verified code. In KIV the design process for high assurance systems proceeds as follows. ; ; 1.; ; KIV supports both functional and state based software/system design using algebraic specifications or Abstract State Machines (ASMs), respectively. As a first step, predefined theories from a library can be imported. New specifications are added to the hierarchically structured specification graph which is graphically visualized.; ; ; ; ; 2.; ; In addition to the specification, a formal safety/security model is defined. The formulation of extra validation properties helps to detect gross specification errors before it is attempted to prove the main safety/security properties.; ; ; ; ; 3.; ; It has to be shown that the validation and safety/security properties are satisfied by the specification. The necessary formal proofs are done in an interactive graphical proof environment. Proof search is automated to a large extent. Proof engineering facilities help to reveal specification errors. After correcting the specification, invalid proofs can be reused automatically.; ; ; ; ; 4.; ; The components of the hierarchical system specification can be implemented independently (modular) using an imperative programming language. Proof obligations for the correctness of the implementation are generated automatically and have to be verified by the proof component. Again, corrected errors lead to invalidated proofs which can be reused automatically.; ; ; ; ; 5.; ; The whole specification and verification process is guarded by an elaborate correctness management. If, finally, every specification and implementation is in “proved state”, it guarantees that there are no inconsistencies and all proof obligations and used lemmas are proved.; ; ; ; ; 6.; ; For use in future projects, specifications and implementations can be added to a library.",,,330,337,Modular design; Mathematical proof; Formal specification; Hierarchical control system; Abstract state machines; Executable; Programming language; Automated theorem proving; Implementation; Algebraic specification; Software; Prototype Verification System; Systems design; Computer science; Design process; Correctness; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48257-1_23 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-48257-1_23 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fm/fm1998.html#BalserRSS98 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-48257-1_23.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/22182102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-48257-1_23,,10.1007/3-540-48257-1_23,1542970284,,0,014-593-293-189-868; 015-544-639-646-006; 026-690-944-033-497; 032-169-466-007-47X; 039-543-544-251-120; 048-743-222-780-516; 065-259-597-038-045; 079-429-415-005-531; 085-407-096-589-612; 089-080-555-302-97X; 089-778-221-588-44X; 100-731-757-136-001; 101-635-659-689-442; 105-620-622-527-144; 118-157-795-325-655; 126-650-758-092-281; 139-807-787-781-056; 140-329-657-616-02X; 143-156-623-742-972; 151-591-470-157-014; 155-426-160-695-761; 176-197-240-615-472; 184-044-966-704-362; 189-956-147-013-49X,12,false,,

This remains valid, if different agents can only interact via messages. It even permits a strict separation between memory managing agents and other agents that can only access the shared memory by sending query and update requests. This paper is dedicated to an investigation of replicated data that is maintained by a memory management subsystem, where the replication neither appears in the requests nor in the corresponding answers. We specify the behaviour of a concurrent system with such memory management using concurrent communicating ASMs (ccASMs), provide several refinements addressing different replication policies and internal messaging between data centres, and analyse their effects on the runs with respect to consistency. We show that on a concrete level even a weak form of consistency is only possible, if view serialisability can be guaranteed.",,,219,234,Distributed computing; Consistency (database systems); Shared memory; Abstract state machines; Concurrent computing; Memory management; Computer science; Replication (computing),,,,,https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/handle/11250/2649756 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/medi/medi2019.html#Schewe0B19 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1902.html#abs-1902-04789 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_16 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_16,,10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_16,2981528793,,0,012-647-218-770-044; 025-811-569-298-195; 026-596-307-502-309; 027-319-823-982-370; 028-958-060-185-732; 033-092-785-757-554; 034-400-132-510-675; 037-445-945-364-220; 037-765-632-256-264; 040-160-680-572-188; 041-034-059-590-707; 058-974-031-275-841; 061-906-386-556-953; 092-195-924-604-606; 125-392-303-019-904; 139-330-264-873-706; 144-592-874-855-231; 154-888-570-385-520; 185-901-831-344-531; 186-860-254-309-725; 189-521-689-083-502,2,true,,green

Jackson,"Model-Integrated Computing (MIC) is an approach to Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), which has been developed primarily for embedded systems. MIC places strong emphasis on the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSML-s) and model transformations. A metamodeling process facilitated by the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) tool suite enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSML-s. However, the specification of semantics for DSML-s is still a hard problem. In order to simplify the DSML semantics, this paper discusses semantic anchoring, which is based on the transformational specification of semantics. Using a mathematical model, Abstract State Machine (ASM), as a common semantic framework, we have developed formal operational semantics for a set of basic models of computations, called semantic units. Semantic anchoring of DSML-s means the specification of model transformations between DSML-s (or aspects of complex DSML-s) and selected semantic units. The paper describes the semantic anchoring process using the meta-programmable MIC tool suite.",,,115,129,Semantics; Domain-specific language; Abstract state machines; Artificial intelligence; Operational semantics; Modeling language; Parsing; Programming language; Semantic analysis (machine learning); Generic Modeling Environment; Software architecture; Computer science; Semantic computing; Software development; Formal methods; Semantics of logic; Metamodeling,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ecmdafa/ecmdafa2005.html#0003SAJ05 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11581741_10 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/semantic-anchoring-model-transformations/ https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/sites/default/files/Chen_K_11_7_2005_Semantic_A.pdf http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/sites/default/files/Chen_K_11_7_2005_Semantic_A.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11581741_10 https://core.ac.uk/display/20922601 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ecmdafa/ecmdafa2005.html#0003SAJ05,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11581741_10,,10.1007/11581741_10,2162354236,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 002-879-383-821-925; 003-776-658-655-546; 005-073-171-618-032; 011-116-798-854-594; 027-587-253-875-266; 028-788-300-731-677; 030-207-024-018-878; 033-690-193-712-707; 037-337-501-383-465; 048-760-252-034-316; 056-769-592-599-269; 067-209-706-756-159; 069-107-782-970-793; 070-358-279-433-271; 076-073-572-022-016; 076-767-312-466-020; 079-723-355-085-863; 081-022-867-996-249; 086-506-832-574-68X; 088-012-407-050-722; 094-828-667-004-801; 105-620-622-527-144; 123-049-511-718-530; 139-330-264-873-706; 140-587-616-038-595; 143-401-966-055-871; 157-311-554-599-521; 189-521-689-083-502; 199-717-846-168-874,103,false,,

Whilst there is an Oracle implementation of SASL, its documentation also contains informal descriptions and under-defined specifications of the RFCs. This paper provides clarification of ambiguity in SASL using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This clarification is based on two ASM essential notions: a ground model to capture the intended SASL behavior in an understandable way, and a refinement notion to accurately explicate the ambiguous parts of the behavior.

Main features of the model include usage of timestamps, flattening, unified and independent behaviour of function block interfaces. This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language.

However, meta-languages such as the MOF (Meta Object Facility)--combined with the OCL (Object Constraint Language) for expressing constraints--used to specify metamodels focus on structural and static semantics but have no built-in support for specifying behavioral semantics. This paper introduces a formal semantic framework for the definition of the semantics of metamodel-based languages. Using metamodelling principles, we propose several techniques, some based on the translational approach while others based on the weaving approach, all showing how the Abstract State Machine formal method can be integrated with current metamodel engineering environments to endow language metamodels with precise and executable semantics.; ; We exemplify the use of our semantic framework by applying the proposed techniques to the OMG metamodelling framework for the behaviour specification of the Finite State Machines provided in terms of a metamodel.",16,3,415,454,Semantics; Object Constraint Language; Abstract state machines; Executable; Model-based design; Programming language; Meta-Object Facility; Computer science; Model-driven architecture; Formal methods; Metamodeling,Metamodelling; Model-based development; Model driven engineering; Formal methods; Abstract state machines; Language semantics; Semantic (meta-)hooking; Weaving behaviour,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/22845 https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/64552 http://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/jase09.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ase/ase16.html#GargantiniRS09 https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/juse09.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-009-0053-0 https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-009-0053-0 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10515-009-0053-0 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10515-009-0053-0 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10515-009-0053-0.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-009-0053-0,,10.1007/s10515-009-0053-0,2142311368,,1,003-222-418-546-848; 003-776-658-655-546; 017-648-710-656-944; 022-204-035-680-062; 028-576-186-413-880; 032-320-224-848-988; 032-354-281-297-321; 034-338-661-112-598; 037-812-871-655-069; 042-513-525-606-759; 043-956-404-991-194; 045-881-266-370-259; 048-121-199-146-456; 050-309-871-652-59X; 053-887-690-431-45X; 061-894-295-420-641; 063-697-874-512-049; 069-107-782-970-793; 076-767-312-466-020; 079-853-335-989-617; 084-075-581-697-188; 086-860-623-731-863; 090-876-580-086-374; 094-828-667-004-801; 103-757-510-147-563; 107-951-376-782-623; 114-352-968-214-768; 115-241-934-589-849; 117-717-417-867-533; 139-330-264-873-706; 140-123-287-914-64X; 142-990-984-056-685; 157-928-221-212-130; 161-343-908-907-538; 162-161-663-002-755; 167-345-480-076-717; 170-464-011-683-100; 177-021-677-462-971; 185-928-584-954-868; 189-521-689-083-502; 199-188-259-902-121,56,false,,

We show that under our operational semantics, DES models correspond to a certain form of abstract state machines (ASMs) such that the Future Event List (FEL) is part of the transition system state and the transition function is based on event routines. Unlike other formalisms proposed for DES (such as Petri Nets or DEVS), our ASM semantics takes all basic DES concepts (like event types and the FEL) into consideration and allows for expressive transition system states representing the objects, properties, relations and functions of the evolving possible worlds of a simulation run. As a direct formal semantics of DES, it provides a basis for comparing, and explaining design choices in, different DES approaches.",,,762,773,Possible world; Abstract state machines; Discrete event simulation; Operational semantics; Programming language; Transition system; Petri net; Computer science; DEVS; Semantics of logic,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wsc/wsc2017.html#Wagner17a https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3242181.3242239 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8247830/,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wsc/wsc2017.html#Wagner17a,,,2783548027,,0,,2,false,,

This process is cumbersome and costly. This paper reports preliminary results on an approach to further automate this process. The approach consists of combining automated test case generation based on systematically exploring the program's input domain, with runtime analysis, where execution traces are monitored and verified against temporal logic specifications, or analyzed using advanced algorithms for detecting concurrency errors such as data races and deadlocks. The approach suggests to generate specifications dynamically per input instance rather than statically once-and-for-all.

XQuery and other high-level query languages for XML documents are not yet implemented by commercial products. Yet many browsers have already built-in XSLT support for transforming XML documents. XSLT is a standard way of performing structural rearrangement or presentational transformation of XML documents, but formulating complex queries is, compared to XQuery, difficult and errorprone. If XQuery expressions could be translated into XSLT (e.g. by a translator written in Java or XSLT itself), the benefits of XQuery would be immediately available to a wide range of commercial products. This paper introduces a process for translating queries formulated in XQuery syntax into XSL stylesheets. The process is described independently from a particular implementation by means of an ASM (Abstract State Machine). The ASM traverses the parse tree of a particular query and translates each node into corresponding XSLT commands. The result of this translation process is an XSL stylesheet that can be applied to an XML document in order to perform the given query. The presented ASM can be easily coded in Java or XSLT to implement a prototype XQ2XSL translator.",,,239,252,XSL; Processing Instruction; XSLT; XML database; Query language; Programming language; Information retrieval; XQuery; Computer science; Streaming XML; XML,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46140-X_19 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46140-X_19 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/er/erw2001.html#LechnerPS01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-46140-x_19,,10.1007/3-540-46140-x_19,1548946274,,0,000-855-181-978-36X; 015-617-769-529-697; 024-520-614-355-958; 042-513-525-606-759; 063-874-073-212-171; 088-012-407-050-722; 094-512-586-911-230; 098-335-968-852-601; 105-357-606-754-27X; 128-183-873-166-840; 147-500-061-251-762; 147-867-134-211-86X; 186-901-356-201-801,10,false,,

Its polymorphic entities (types, operators, axioms) can easily be equipped with a ‘naive' semantics defined in terms of collections of instances. However, this semantics has the unpleasant property that while model reduction preserves satisfaction of sentences, model expansion generally does not. In other words, unless further measures are taken, type class polymorphism fails to constitute a proper institution, being only a so-called rps preinstitution; this is unfortunate, as it means that one cannot use institution-independent or heterogeneous structuring languages, proof calculi, and tools with it.; ; Here, we suggest to remedy this problem by modifying the notion of model to include information also about its potential future extensions. Our construction works at a high level of generality in the sense that it provides, for any preinstitution, an institution in which the original preinstitution can be represented. The semantics of polymorphism used in the specification language HasCasl makes use of this result. In fact, HasCasl's polymorphism is a special case of a general notion of polymorphism in institutions introduced here, and our construction leads to the right notion of semantic consequence when applied to this generic polymorphism. The appropriateness of the construction for other frameworks that share the same problem depends on methodological questions to be decided case by case. In particular, it turns out that our method is apparently unsuitable for observational logics, while it works well with abstract state machine formalisms such as state-based Casl.",,,234,251,Special case; Semantics; Type constructor; Ad hoc polymorphism; Abstract state machines; Polymorphism (computer science); Axiom; Programming language; Specification language; Algebraic specification; Formalism (philosophy); Computer science,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/24527772 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wadt/wadt2004.html#SchroderML04 http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~cxl/papers/wadt04b.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-31959-7_14 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-31959-7_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-31959-7_14,,10.1007/978-3-540-31959-7_14,1647005630,,0,002-456-165-219-974; 006-564-489-365-20X; 012-372-066-533-196; 013-180-328-438-309; 018-232-019-316-694; 026-769-595-131-583; 033-258-999-832-481; 036-228-923-874-433; 036-521-105-390-085; 038-162-855-510-972; 038-380-847-015-088; 038-435-089-836-826; 041-037-889-916-108; 046-682-144-991-65X; 056-816-637-751-113; 057-186-421-147-139; 057-193-159-416-801; 060-749-601-164-192; 064-373-571-990-735; 068-172-037-508-333; 074-675-087-244-753; 075-481-253-315-731; 080-929-288-220-533; 081-798-238-066-442; 093-349-240-261-636; 102-284-957-538-022; 103-956-273-978-014; 110-312-872-318-077; 110-530-004-843-352; 133-582-439-919-538; 136-052-623-803-528; 137-458-180-337-762; 145-546-181-382-223; 147-371-977-482-538; 150-349-213-451-261; 151-275-169-678-369; 165-786-575-756-61X; 171-850-743-290-718; 175-412-058-931-05X; 197-218-911-486-707,17,true,,green

In reality, of course, there are no miracles. A message goes from one network to another; it can be lost or corrupted in the process. Here, we present a realistic but high-level communication model where abstract communicators represent various nets and subnets. The model was originally developed in the process of specifying a particular network architecture, namely, the Universal Plug and Play architecture. But, it is general. Our contention is that every message-based distributed system, properly abstracted, gives rise to a specialization of our abstract communication model. The purpose of the abstract communication model is not to design a new kind of network; rather, it is to discover the common part of all message-based communication networks. The generality of the model has been confirmed by its successful reuse for very different distributed architectures. The model is based on distributed abstract state machines.

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable ""semantic units"" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification.

017-187-107-384-228,Towards a comprehensive extension of abstract state machines for aspect-oriented specification,,2016,journal article,Science of Computer Programming,01676423,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Marcel Dausend; Alexander Raschke,"Abstract With the paradigm of aspect-orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program's logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Those aspect-oriented specifications often can be more easily reused than extensions that are implemented directly into an existing specification. Another use case is the extension of a specification with new functionality or features. Although this would be possible with refinement too, with aspect-orientation it is not necessary to augment the original specification with “extension points” that can be used for refinement. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect-oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented according to an aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. The applicability of aspect-oriented specification in the context of ASM is demonstrated by means of examples, e.g. implementing a fading aspect into the light control system specification of a former ASM case study. Finally, the paper gives a brief overview about the developed tool that supports the writing of aspect-oriented ASMs.",131,,22,41,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Specification language; Syntax (programming languages); Computer science; Aspect-oriented programming; System requirements specification; Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642316300168 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp131.html#DausendR16 https://oparu.uni-ulm.de/xmlui/handle/123456789/13647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2016.04.007,,10.1016/j.scico.2016.04.007,2346774892,,0,012-128-078-094-077; 016-518-569-550-70X; 026-476-847-126-74X; 041-517-722-797-71X; 043-387-003-850-22X; 046-323-920-158-771; 050-748-749-007-719; 057-092-273-178-939; 063-136-567-423-935; 066-438-289-080-25X; 083-406-778-129-800; 085-150-953-954-40X; 093-386-582-973-679; 109-226-156-590-33X; 118-317-992-753-595; 164-089-376-944-116; 189-019-422-819-118; 189-521-689-083-502; 193-996-632-030-972; 199-166-900-005-729,1,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

In the course of the design and the extension of an executable specification language based on the Abstract State Machines formalism we recently performed a user survey. The question, how new language features are comprehended, remains unsolved. The main emphasis of this study is on eye gaze behavior of participants learning language features. Eye-tracking experiments were performed in two different countries using a Pupil Labs eye-tracking headset. An example specification and simple comprehension tasks were used as stimuli. The preliminary results of the eye-gaze behaviour analysis reveal that the new language feature was undestood well, but the new abstractions were frequently confused by participants. The foreknowledge of specific programming concepts is crucial how these abstractions are comprehended.

Various UML diagrams are used for specification of different aspects of the application. Their interpretation, extension, revision and integration becomes awful difficult if developers use the full freedom of UML, apply their own semantics and do not agree an common parts. We propose an approach that limits this freedom to the necessary extend. Developers have the full freedom on parts of the specification that is independent from others and are committed to fulfill contracts on parts of the specification that is also used by other developers.; ; Due to a lack of semantics the integration of various UML diagrams is often left to the intuition of software engineers, which bears the risk of UML-based software development becoming error-prone. In this paper we propose the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as a means to support the integration of UML diagrams by means of invertible translations of UML clusters, i.e. sets of UML diagrams together with constraints defined on them, into easily understandable ASM specifications. In doing so, the rigorous semantics of ASMs induces an unambiguous semantics for the UML clusters. These translations themselves can be formalised by ASM specifications thereby automating the translation process. Furthermore, the evolution of UML clusters is guarded by contracts, which can again by specified by ASMs.",,,111,129,Unified Modeling Language; UML tool; Sequence diagram; Programming language; Class diagram; Computer science; Applications of UML; Software development; Diagramming software; Shlaer–Mellor method,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_8 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/borger2009.html#SchmidtT09 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_8,,10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_8,1592508745,,0,004-087-347-600-364; 019-630-553-653-797; 022-955-585-690-019; 025-272-082-632-075; 026-737-803-452-685; 027-168-423-868-83X; 029-820-215-875-987; 030-334-926-838-172; 032-531-072-620-73X; 042-457-330-095-326; 044-328-373-269-72X; 066-006-964-963-613; 068-419-504-455-042; 076-536-409-488-48X; 080-192-627-153-205; 090-876-580-086-374; 096-005-773-435-141; 109-552-559-143-618; 165-336-120-919-840; 181-631-780-566-819; 189-521-689-083-502; 198-492-232-208-527,3,false,,

This paper first proposes a formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The formal description for main artifact of the standard (function block) is presented in the paper. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model checker which is used to formally verify properties of applications developed in IEC 61499 standard. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the formal verification of the IEC 61499 control systems. The paper also highlights the other uses of verification such as portability of IEC 61499 based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard.

The resulting key artefact is called workflow chart and still models the control flow of business processes but puts more emphasis on user interaction modelling. Workflow charts are specified as tripartite directed graphs and describe an alternative sequence of typed nodes for showing information and providing forms for user input.

The application of a rigorous process for their development reduces the risk of failures since validation and verification activities can be performed in a objective, reproducible, and documentable manner. In this paper we present an approach based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method. Starting from the model, validation and verification (V&V) techniques can be applied. Furthermore, by step-wise refinement, a final model can be obtained, which can be automatically translated to Open image in new window code. The process is applied to the smart pill box case study. Starting from the ASM model, we generate Open image in new window code for the Arduino platform after the application of V&V activities. Furthermore, we introduce regulation (IEC62304) and guidelines (FDA General Principles of Software Validation) that support the developer in medical software development. In particular, we explain how ASMs formal process can be compliant with them.",11771,,89,103,Image (mathematics); Arduino; Abstract state machines; Embedded system; Code (cryptography); Window (computing); Medical software; Computer science; Formal methods; Process (computing),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/tools/tools2019.html#BombardaBG19 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29852-4_7 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29852-4_7 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/150814 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-29852-4_7.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29852-4_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29852-4_7,,10.1007/978-3-030-29852-4_7,2977367339,,0,004-523-713-863-964; 015-094-671-158-47X; 030-611-729-748-058; 033-714-385-087-807; 043-041-984-218-601; 046-838-597-306-588; 058-018-534-281-063; 068-237-782-561-390; 076-114-730-211-946; 085-278-493-726-942; 116-020-178-965-729; 122-512-813-599-624; 123-082-630-503-713; 133-848-678-790-175; 139-330-264-873-706; 154-550-982-498-232; 174-703-294-468-398; 189-521-689-083-502,14,false,,

However, many formal methods rely on a refinement-based development process which poses problems for their integration into agile processes. We consider redundancies within refinement hierarchies as a challenge for the practical application of stepwise refinement and propose superimposition-based modularization of refinement steps as a potential solution. While traditionally, each model in a refinement hierarchy must be developed and maintained separately, our concept allows developers to specify the refinement steps that transform a model into a refined one. We have developed tool support for the language AsmetaL and evaluated our approach by means of a case study. The results indicate a reduction of complexity for the development artifacts in terms of their overall size by 48.6% for the ground model and four refinements. Furthermore, the case study shows that superimposition-based refinement eases the development of alternative refinements for exploratory development and to cope with changing requirements. Thus, we consider this work as a step towards agile formal methods that are tailored to support iterative development, facilitating their incorporation into agile development processes.",,,19,35,Modularity; Software engineering; Agile software development; Iterative and incremental development; Abstract state machines; Computer science; Process (engineering); Formal methods; Agile Unified Process; Modular programming,Formal methods; Agile methods; Refinement; Modularity; Superimposition; Abstract state machines,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-68690-5_2 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icfem/icfem2017.html#BenduhnTSS17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2,,10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2,2763250045,,0,003-133-365-546-590; 004-658-725-907-299; 008-949-732-059-369; 010-093-344-106-481; 010-553-539-781-211; 014-658-440-497-962; 018-813-271-987-532; 019-018-332-749-866; 021-518-769-824-032; 022-642-232-517-811; 022-872-634-865-310; 022-955-585-690-019; 027-268-525-159-91X; 027-468-667-135-338; 027-940-163-523-026; 028-013-666-858-046; 028-792-689-630-701; 030-346-586-562-146; 030-920-587-764-616; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-079-624-756-003; 043-937-848-217-374; 048-174-621-765-826; 051-415-616-027-784; 055-152-904-810-195; 058-496-004-475-406; 062-561-989-848-248; 065-510-884-155-161; 067-678-153-508-682; 081-898-897-809-199; 087-129-866-492-100; 089-371-912-827-396; 089-996-407-346-946; 093-849-617-670-490; 094-370-227-985-915; 099-187-607-134-14X; 100-638-520-723-965; 109-460-512-355-404; 109-487-376-230-163; 120-587-910-077-450; 121-535-580-743-263; 123-082-630-503-713; 139-330-264-873-706; 145-070-700-492-395; 147-019-981-692-623; 154-550-982-498-232; 156-644-867-736-071; 164-463-044-157-818; 181-401-889-710-788,3,false,,

BPMN issued by the Object Management Group is a widely used standard for business process modeling. However, major drawbacks of BPMN include its limited support for organizational modeling, its only implicit expression of modalities, and its lack of integrated user interaction and data modeling. Further, in many cases the syntactical and, in particular, semantic definitions of BPMN are inaccurate, incomplete or inconsistent. The book addresses concrete issues concerning the execution semantics of business processes and provides a formal definition of BPMN process diagrams, which can serve as a sound basis for further extensions, i.e., in the form of horizontal refinements of the core language. To this end, the Abstract State Machine (ASMs) method is used to formalize the semantics of BPMN. ASMs have demonstrated their value in various domains, e.g. specifying the semantics of programming or modeling languages, verifying the specification of the Java Virtual Machine, or formalizing the ITIL change management process. This kind of improvement promotes more consistency in the interpretation of comprehensive models, as well as real exchangeability of models between different tools. In the outlook at the end of the book, the authors conclude with proposing extensions that address actor modeling (including an intuitive way to denote permissions and obligations), integration of user-centric views, a refined communication concept, and data integration.",,,29,152,Software engineering; Formal specification; XPDL; Business Process Model and Notation; Modeling language; Systems engineering; Business process modeling; Computer science; Formal methods; Business process management; Business process,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09931-6_4 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09931-6_4 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09931-6_4/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09931-6_4,,10.1007/978-3-319-09931-6_4,303066282,,0,016-010-318-187-590; 020-460-657-876-430; 023-729-191-099-673; 026-749-668-861-58X; 029-252-589-031-321; 034-736-796-819-826; 036-170-596-836-026; 044-694-642-596-113; 047-171-023-451-405; 048-694-751-428-325; 074-873-514-254-022; 092-033-102-549-116; 113-287-309-430-120; 133-264-905-125-986; 140-674-560-716-304; 143-051-784-789-201; 149-773-375-078-831; 191-972-117-212-203,38,false,,

Integrating Object-Z with a more concrete notation is a sound strategy. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce an approach to model-checking Object-Z specifications based on first integrating Object-Z with the Abstract State Machine (ASM) notation to get the notation OZ-ASM.

Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications. Almost all built-in behaviors are implicitly defined inside a concrete ASM language implementation and thus, the behavior is hidden from the language user. In this paper, we present a new ASM syntax extension based on traits, which allows the specifier (language user) to define new type abstractions in the form of structure and behavior definitions to reuse, maintain, structure, and extend the functionality in ASM specifications. We describe the proposed language construct by defining its syntax and semantics. The decision to use a trait-based syntax extension over other object-oriented language constructs like interfaces or mixins was motivated and driven by the results of previously conducted empirical studies. Moreover, we outline details about the implementation of the trait-based syntax extension in our Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language implementation.",,,237,243,Abstract state machines; Semantics (computer science); Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Construct (python library); Syntax (programming languages); Computer science; Language construct; Specifier; Formal methods,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2020.html#PaulweberPZ20 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-48077-6_17 https://eprints.cs.univie.ac.at/6397 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-48077-6_17.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17,,10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17,3028561472,,0,010-852-259-152-365; 011-283-753-736-189; 017-279-844-021-88X; 019-113-402-382-947; 027-587-253-875-266; 028-157-911-232-198; 029-858-763-538-985; 030-219-725-823-27X; 033-538-264-444-978; 034-542-802-471-470; 038-864-372-635-54X; 060-776-050-843-781; 074-291-812-104-639; 076-967-105-634-518; 082-714-949-563-192; 100-712-624-370-474; 106-113-148-648-052; 139-330-264-873-706; 150-651-154-106-309; 155-401-428-919-914; 167-303-943-230-544; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,2,true,,bronze

Some of today’s most advanced automatic program verifiers, however, rely on non-temporal theories, particularly Hoare-style logic. Can we still take advantage of this sophisticated verification technology for more challenging systems? As a step towards a positive answer, we have defined a translation scheme from temporal specifications to contract-equipped object-oriented programs, expressed in Eiffel and hence open for processing by the AutoProof program prover. We have applied this scheme to a published CTL model of a widely used realistic example, the “landing gear” system which has been the subject of numerous competing specifications. An attempt to verify the result in AutoProof failed to prove one temporal property, which on further inspection seemed to be wrong in the original published model, even though the published work claimed to have verified an Abstract State Machine implementation of that model. Correcting the CTL specification to reflect the apparent informal attempt, re-translating again to contracted Eiffel and re-running the verification leads to success. The LTL-to-contracted-Eiffel process is still ad hoc, and tailored to generate the kind of scheme that the target verification tool (AutoProof) can handle best, rather than the simplest or most elegant scheme.

021-878-070-887-207,A formal specification of the semantics of ECMAScript,2011-02-07,2011,book,,,,,Cristian Dittamo; Vincenzo Gervasi; Egon Boerger; Antonio Cisternino,"Web applications (i.e., applications whose interface is presented to the user via a web browser, whose state is split between a server and a client, and where the only interaction between server and client is through the HTTP protocol) are become more and more widespread, and integrated in most users' everyday work habits. The glue linking the desperate technologies involved, from dynamic HTML to XML RPC, is the Javascript language. Yet, no formal definition of its semantics exists, which in turn makes it impossible to formally prove correctness, liveness and security properties of Web applications. As a first step towards improving this situation, we provide a formal semantics for ECMAScript (standard ECMA-262), by means of an Abstract State Machines (ASMs) specification. We follow the path established by other specification efforts for similar languages (e.g. Java and C#), but in addition we establish a formal trace between parts of our specification and the ECMA standard, thus facilitating the proof of correctness of the specification. More specifically, we define the dynamic semantics of ECMAScript by providing (in terms of ASMs) an interpreter which executes ECMAScript programs. We use an algebra to represent the state of the ECMAScript program, the state of the ECMAScript interpreter, and the state of the host environment (typically, the browser). We assume the necessary syntactic information (namely, the annotated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the given program) to be available. Using ASM we detail a visit of the AST, whose effect is to simulate the execution of the program. In the ECMA standard the behavior of ECMAScript constructs is operationally described using so-called abstract operations (AO), coming as numbered lists of steps. Therefore our interpreter is composed out of two submachines: ECMA-Script and ECMA-AO interpreters. The former invokes the ECMA-AO one to evaluate nodes, simulating AOs used in ECMA standard to describe the production's semantics. We organize the ECMA-AO interpreter rules in such a way that each rule application corresponds to an AO instruction in the ECMA standard. This helps to check the correctness of the ASM model wrt the ECMA standard as well as the correctness of implementations wrt ASM model. Therefore, the state of our interpreter can be mapped via abstraction/refinement functions onto the concrete state of any comformant implementation.",,,,,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Dynamic HTML; Liveness; Programming language; Computer science; JavaScript; Correctness; Abstract syntax tree,,,,,http://eprints.adm.unipi.it/2268/,http://eprints.adm.unipi.it/2268/,,,1565807088,,0,,3,false,,

In this paper, we present an approach verifying SystemC designs using model checking and assertion based verification. Such verification is enabled through two transformations from SystemC to AsmL (the Abstract State Machines Language) and vice-versa. The soundness of these transformations, proved using abstract interpretation, guarantees the correctness of the model checking results and the validity of the generated assertion monitors (to be checked by simulation). We illustrate our approach on the SystemC/AsmL modeling and verification of the widely used Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard.

A very useful type of model in computing is an abstract state machine which describes transitions over first order structures. The general purpose model-based testing tool SpecExplorer (used within Microsoft, also available externally) uses such a model, written in AsmL or Spec#, to perform a search that checks that all reachable states of the model are safe, and also to check conformance of an arbitrary .NET implementation to the model. Spec Explorer provides a variety of ways to cut down the state space of the model, for instance by finitizing parameter domains or by providing predicate abstraction. It has already found subtle bugs in production software.; ; First order structures and abstract state machines over them are also a useful way to think about cryptographic protocols, since models formulated in these terms arise by natural abstraction from computational cryptography.; ; In this paper we explain this abstraction process, 'experiments as structures', and argue for its faithfulness. We show how the Dolev-Yao intruder model fits into SpecExplorer. In a word, the actions of the Dolev-Yao intruder are the 'controllable' actions of the testing framework, whereas the actions of protocol participants are the 'observable' actions of the model. The unsafe states are the states violating say Lowe's security guarantees. Under this view, the general purpose software testing tool quickly finds known attacks, such as Lowe's attack on the Needham-Schroeder protocol.",3705,,33,60,Abstract state machines; Model-based testing; Finite-state machine; Cryptography; Software; Predicate abstraction; Abstract interpretation; Turing machine; Cryptographic protocol; Computer science; Abstraction (linguistics); State space; Theoretical computer science; Metamodeling,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/model-based-testing-of-cryptographic-protocols/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/tgc/tgc2005.html#RosenzweigRS05 https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/217001.protocoltesting-lncs.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11580850_4 https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=77433 http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/77433/ModelBasedTestingOfCrypto(TGC2005).pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/11580850_4 http://core.ac.uk/display/24467368 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11580850_4 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005LNCS.3705...33R/abstract https://link.springer.com/10.1007/11580850_4 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/ModelBasedTestingOfCryptoTGC2005.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11580850_4,,10.1007/11580850_4,2100732913,,0,002-438-766-985-114; 002-779-751-546-659; 015-887-653-061-930; 018-408-105-437-771; 022-222-175-777-957; 024-438-822-402-664; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-036-161-224-827; 040-437-352-585-202; 043-150-652-062-148; 043-603-394-001-404; 059-872-779-763-000; 079-643-779-313-372; 079-723-355-085-863; 087-112-381-266-761; 092-044-801-667-182; 127-265-490-736-503; 132-831-968-463-386; 133-375-412-244-057; 161-581-499-219-980; 165-436-330-716-740,11,false,,

We propose to use Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as the formal basis for dealing with changes in Linked Data, which is the combination of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). We provide a synthesis of ASMs and Linked Data and show how the combination aligns with the relevant specifications such as the Request/Response communication in HTTP, the guidelines for updating resource state in the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification, and the formal grounding of RDF in model theory. Based on the formalisation of Linked Data resources that change state over time, we present the syntax and operational semantics of a small rule-based language to specify user agents that use HTTP to interact with Linked Data as the interface to the environment. We show the feasibility of the approach in an evaluation involving the specification of automation in a Smart Building scenario, where the presented approach serves as a theoretical foundation.",,,,,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; RDF; Hypertext Transfer Protocol; Operational semantics; Semantic Web; Linked Data Platform; Computer science; Linked data; User agent,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/ldow2018.html#KaferH18 http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2073/article-05.pdf https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000092987 https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000092987/28685221,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/ldow2018.html#KaferH18,,,2902789402,,0,000-293-107-513-087; 000-988-990-487-762; 008-981-560-892-767; 011-687-596-684-549; 015-232-103-858-112; 022-937-891-264-06X; 023-196-790-117-90X; 033-620-105-845-427; 049-368-346-480-552; 049-676-302-228-587; 055-521-941-760-087; 063-257-380-472-033; 078-854-216-668-608; 081-527-810-464-106; 089-837-610-391-875; 105-620-622-527-144; 109-227-147-972-875; 119-133-627-083-634; 121-714-201-450-756; 122-273-752-484-034; 122-748-228-161-972; 129-809-886-434-857; 131-975-416-571-502; 142-373-452-677-348; 144-137-524-543-41X; 146-206-205-926-420; 157-252-978-638-46X; 169-863-324-925-10X; 184-084-194-330-001; 184-569-333-444-523,13,false,,

Such processes generally rely on formal methods, which can guarantee, thanks to their mathematical foundation, model preciseness, and properties assurance. However, they are rarely adopted in practice. In this paper, we report our experience in using the Abstract State Machine formal method and the ASMETA framework in developing a prototype of the control software of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to time constraints and lack of skills, no formal method was applied for the MVM project. However, we here want to assess the feasibility of developing (part of) the ventilator by using a formal method-based approach. Our development process starts from a high-level formal specification of the system to describe the MVM main operation modes. Then, through a sequence of refined models, all the other requirements are captured, up to a level in which a C++ implementation of a prototype of the MVM controller is automatically generated from the model, and tested. Along the process, at each refinement level, different model validation and verification activities are performed, and each refined model is proved to be a correct refinement of the previous level. By means of the MVM case study, we evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our formal approach.",349,,13,29,Software engineering; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Code (cryptography); Usability; Computer science; Process (engineering); Certification; Formal methods; Control theory,,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/197122?mode=full.5974,http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/eptcs.349.2,,10.4204/eptcs.349.2,3212382673; 3212540731,,0,000-019-850-626-748; 005-034-754-786-204; 006-824-809-718-86X; 015-094-671-158-47X; 017-630-670-472-95X; 019-113-402-382-947; 019-660-605-202-953; 024-247-150-276-957; 033-714-385-087-807; 039-063-292-173-935; 039-363-292-545-334; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-403-303-181-446; 051-415-616-027-784; 059-979-298-964-573; 070-927-256-171-907; 074-005-404-726-279; 086-148-767-839-815; 093-072-327-761-669; 096-620-815-332-12X; 108-819-412-660-200; 122-512-813-599-624; 128-442-171-921-200; 139-330-264-873-706; 146-351-859-518-697; 167-896-065-369-695; 189-521-689-083-502,10,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Abstract state machines (ASMs) used to be called evolving algebras. The sequential ASM thesis and its extensions inspired diverse applications of ASMs. The early applications were driven, at least partially, by the desire to test the thesis. Different programming languages were the obvious challenges. (A programming language L can be viewed as an algorithm that runs a given L program on given data.) From there, applications of (not necessarily sequential) ASMs spread into many directions. So far, the accumulated experimental evidence seems to support the sequential thesis. There is also a speculative philosophical justification of the thesis. It was barely sketched in the literature, but it was discussed at much greater length in numerous lectures of mine. Here I attempt to write down some of those explanations.

Huggins; David Van Campenhout,"Gurevich Abstract State Machines (ASMs) provide a sound mathematical basis for the specification and verification of systems. An application of the ASM methodology to the verification of a pipelined microprocessor (an ARM2 implementation) is described. Both the sequential execution model and final pipelined model are formalized using ASMs. A series of intermediate models are introduced that gradually expose the complications of pipelining. The first intermediate model is proven equivalent to the sequential model in the absence of structural, control, and data hazards. In the following steps, these simplifying assumptions are lifted one by one, and the original proof is refined to establish the equivalence of each intermediate model with the sequential model, leading ultimately to a full proof of equivalence of the sequential and pipelined models.",3,4,563,580,Formal verification; Abstract state machines; Parallel computing; Equivalence (measure theory); Programming language; ARM architecture; Execution model; Sequential model; Microprocessor; Computer science; Functional verification,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/296333.296345 https://core.ac.uk/display/24678428 https://digitalcommons.kettering.edu/computerscience_facultypubs/13/ https://works.bepress.com/jim-huggins/50/ https://doi.org/10.1145/296333.296345 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/todaes/todaes3.html#HugginsC98,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/296333.296345,,10.1145/296333.296345,2063162149,,0,004-558-269-546-97X; 005-062-066-697-548; 014-658-865-366-132; 060-046-569-964-120; 063-229-748-620-48X; 081-791-425-527-927; 096-701-121-721-360; 103-476-548-279-253; 105-620-622-527-144; 130-166-181-657-814; 141-149-201-953-210; 147-500-061-251-762; 176-197-240-615-472; 181-399-011-626-73X; 191-925-997-526-005; 199-685-187-267-014,36,false,,

Chao,"In model-driven engineering (MDE), the unified modeling language (UML) 2.0 metamodel solution includes a metamodel that defines the language concepts and a user model that defines how the language concepts are represented. In UML 2.0, an important usage of metamodel is to ensure model consistency between different diagrams in the user model. However, most existing UML metamodels lack an integrated semantic framework to project each diagram in the user model as a view of the metamodel. To overcome the shortcomings of the current UML 2.0 metamodel approaches, we developed structure-behavior coalescence abstract state machine (SBC-ASM) for metamodel-based language (MBL), which provides an integrated semantic framework that is able to integrate structural constructs with behavioral constructs. Using SBC-ASM MBL as the metamodel solution of UML 2.0, each diagram in the user model can be projected as a view of the SBC-ASM.",15,3,4105,4115,Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Software system; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Computer science; Model-driven architecture; Data modeling; User modeling; Metamodeling,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sj/sj15.html#MaC21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2020.3027195,,10.1109/jsyst.2020.3027195,3198151314,,1,010-179-089-659-624; 010-259-460-265-065; 011-600-934-116-591; 018-310-241-038-972; 031-002-919-997-592; 036-130-582-494-612; 057-024-793-746-560; 068-069-218-370-251; 094-497-106-858-918; 118-651-741-885-650; 122-264-916-987-259; 139-443-501-950-439; 155-590-008-870-603; 197-433-208-487-70X,8,true,,bronze

There exist several techniques for test generation, which, however, may suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we assume that the system under test can be divided in several subsystems such that only one subsystem is active at the time. Moreover, each subsystem decides when and to which other subsystem to pass the control, by also initializing the initial state of the next subsystem in a desired way. We model these systems and we show how it is possible to generate tests in a very efficient way that exploits the division of the entire system in subsystems. Test generation for the whole system is performed by visiting each subsystem and generating tests for it. The tests are combined in order to obtain valid system traces. We show how several visiting policies influence the completeness of the test generation process. We propose a test generation approach for distributed systems with information passing.The generation is performed only considering the single subsystems.The tests for the single subsystems are combined to obtain system valid traces.The policy used to combine the tests influences the completeness of the approach.The approach, compared to techniques considering the whole system, is very efficient.",94,,93,108,System under test; Computer engineering; Initialization; Abstract state machines; Test (assessment); Completeness (statistics); Computer science; Scalability; State (computer science); Division (mathematics); Real-time computing,Test case generation; state explosion problem; information passing; abstraction; State Machines,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp94.html#ArcainiG14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167642314000483 https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/scp_asmtest2014.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/31125 http://www.imtlucca.it/news-events/events/job-market-seminars/file/2.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.007,,10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.007,2132941720,,0,006-244-045-917-365; 011-932-537-338-220; 021-003-498-716-896; 032-479-599-783-61X; 034-099-892-995-61X; 036-367-190-384-583; 040-736-326-793-892; 044-748-027-808-63X; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-299-736-589-511; 050-578-715-624-648; 054-890-739-713-647; 083-083-948-326-126; 088-034-630-494-534; 092-498-931-461-517; 107-735-608-364-425; 118-141-611-261-508; 146-579-344-003-185; 147-019-981-692-623; 155-304-026-125-99X; 170-042-235-963-558; 184-079-944-742-763; 189-521-689-083-502,8,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,green

We provide a new formal framework for algorithm level modelling—design modelling at a high abstraction level, focused exclusively on function and algorithms. The semantics of our models is based on Abstract State Machines with synchronous parallel execution, sequential execution, and nondeterminism. To express models we propose an executable, object-oriented Architecture Specification Language with rich data types and a well-defined formal semantics, based initially on Microsoft's AsmL. We describe an experimental framework for direct symbolic execution of models in this language, intended as a basis for both property and refinement verification, as well as design exploration. We explain and illustrate our approach through a case study, the modelling a simple μop scheduler and its refinement towards a design model for circuit implementation. We aim to show the utility of our language and symbolic execution framework for exploring microarchitectural algorithm and to validate designs using dynamic or formal techniques, yielding more productive convergence to high quality implementations.",,,94,99,Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Formal language; Formal semantics (linguistics); Abstraction layer; Executable; Finite-state machine; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Symbolic execution; Computer science,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5340168/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5340168/ http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005340168 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hldvt/hldvt2009.html#HannaM09,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hldvt.2009.5340168,,10.1109/hldvt.2009.5340168,2101329288,,0,025-270-431-422-06X; 029-858-763-538-985; 043-570-524-603-318; 053-950-243-449-542; 086-791-435-530-646; 091-969-281-158-891; 098-944-026-156-091; 099-206-307-787-190; 101-313-529-406-756; 102-019-023-361-449; 104-460-777-217-38X; 125-163-383-045-942; 131-116-576-918-442; 155-285-003-999-423; 156-800-240-931-801; 194-182-748-017-052,0,true,,green

We here make a proposal of a visual notation for Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and we introduce visual trees that visualize ASM transition rules. In addition to these graphical components that are based only on the syntactical structure of the model, we also present visual patterns that permit to visualize part of the behavior of the machine. A tool is also available to graphically represent ASM models using the proposed notation.",9946,,163,178,Abstract state machines; Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Control flow graph; Visual notation; Visualization; System requirements; Computer science; Notation,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/76960 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/staf/staf2016w.html#ArcainiBGR16 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12,,10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12,2557286485,,0,004-523-713-863-964; 005-919-900-156-170; 009-458-823-413-271; 022-933-376-452-244; 023-768-709-930-989; 025-201-266-753-56X; 025-993-228-024-209; 033-970-130-900-328; 041-282-823-695-858; 046-838-597-306-588; 048-191-200-930-365; 048-671-564-463-836; 051-415-616-027-784; 078-769-584-552-581; 082-129-618-635-49X; 086-859-544-611-152; 099-279-646-831-077; 105-577-735-311-488; 109-631-113-107-984; 116-542-945-764-062; 125-305-031-194-056; 139-330-264-873-706; 139-976-718-596-858; 163-868-701-473-44X; 175-802-599-490-609; 177-110-190-578-440; 178-472-518-205-125; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,8,false,,

024-750-012-894-552,DCM - The Generic Model of Computation,2012-07-30,2012,journal article,Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science,20752180,Open Publishing Association,,Nachum Dershowitz,"state machines (ASMs), invented by Yuri Gurevich [24], constitute a most general model of computation, one that can operate on any desired level of abstraction of data structures and native operations. All (ordinary) models of computation are instances of this one generic paradigm. Here, we give an overview of the foundational considerations underlying the model (cobbled together primarily from [18, 3, 12]).1 Programs (of the sequential, non-interactive variety) in this formalism are built from three components: • There are generalized assignments f (s1, . . . ,sn) := t, where f is any function symbol (in the vocabulary of the program) and the si and t are arbitrary terms (in that vocabulary). • Statements may be prefaced by a conditional test, if C then P or if C then P else Q, where C is a propositional combination of equalities between terms. • Program statements may be composed in parallel, following the keyword do, short for do in parallel. An ASM program describes a single transition step; its statements are executed repeatedly, as a unit, until no assignments have their conditions enabled. (Additional constructs beyond these are needed for interaction and large-scale parallelism, which are not dealt with here.) As a simple example, consider the program shown as Algorithm 1, describing a version of selection sort, where F(0), . . . ,F(n− 1) contain values to be sorted, F being a unary function symbol. Initially, n ≥ 1 is the quantity of values to be sorted, i is set to 0, and j to 1. The brackets indicate statements that are executed in parallel. The program proceeds by repeatedly modifying the values of i and j, as well as of locations in F , referring to terms F(i) and F( j). When all conditions fail, that is, when j = n and i+ 1 = n, the values in F have been sorted vis-a-vis the black-box relation “>”. The program halts, as there is nothing left to do. (Declarations and initializations for program constants and variables are not shown.) This sorting program is not partial to any particular representation of the natural numbers 1, 2, etc., which are being used to index F . Whether an implementation uses natural language, or decimal numbers, 1For a video lecture of Gurevich’s on this subject, see http://www.youtube.com/v/7XfA5EhH7Bc. 2 Generic Model of Computation Algorithm 1 An abstract-state-machine program for sorting. if j = n then if i+1 6= n then do ",88,,59,71,Discrete mathematics; Selection sort; Unary function; Data structure; Finite-state machine; Natural number; Model of computation; Natural language; Mathematics; Decimal; Countable set; Algebra; Abstract state machines; Axiom; Computer science; Computation,,,,,https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1208.2585/ https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2585 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2585 https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.88.5 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1208.2585D/abstract http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/papers/Generic.pdf http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2585,http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/eptcs.88.5,,10.4204/eptcs.88.5,3104526371; 1999079093,,0,001-996-277-886-545; 005-694-138-735-992; 007-883-129-081-670; 011-052-400-879-696; 024-439-760-568-187; 029-858-763-538-985; 031-909-553-637-650; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-754-861-909-065; 038-807-701-463-486; 039-684-420-480-326; 046-491-745-006-297; 046-755-786-049-96X; 057-150-112-041-176; 058-333-645-536-321; 059-216-890-629-904; 060-733-812-776-088; 065-277-702-489-526; 071-623-497-103-503; 080-313-281-594-764; 081-564-980-994-874; 082-815-138-851-468; 084-010-145-144-942; 085-074-725-872-582; 085-994-097-594-260; 094-512-586-911-230; 094-605-927-503-95X; 097-885-033-876-878; 105-620-622-527-144; 111-567-034-049-446; 113-740-395-634-754; 133-375-412-244-057; 138-094-703-131-205; 147-069-557-400-64X; 159-988-624-301-688; 169-073-447-115-709; 192-388-357-887-836,12,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Among many other existing problems in cloud computing, we identified the lack of client orientation and lack of formal foundations as serious deficiencies. In this chapter, we give a summary on our research and discuss the architectures as well as the formal models of some software solutions with which we are going to address (a part of) these two problems in cloud computing.The solution we propose is a novel and uniform client-cloud interaction approach by which cloud service owners, who may be different from the cloud providers, are able to fully control the usage of their services in the case of each user subscription. In this context, any cloud service can be invoked by distinct devices; therefore, the content must be adapted to various channels and end devices, in particular with respect to needs arising from mobile clients. For a quick and seamless integration between the cloud provider’s identity management system and the system used by the client, we introduce the concept of a client-centric tool. An extension of the client-cloud interaction model enables client-to-client interaction (CTCI) in an almost direct way, so that the involvement of cloud services is transparent to the users.In this chapter, we propose a formalization of this solution that incorporates the major advantages of abstract state machines (ASMs) and ambient calculus by specifying the algorithms of executable components (agents) in terms of ASMs and by describing their communication topology, locality, and mobility in the terms of ambient calculus.",,,83,144,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Executable; Software; Identity management system; Locality; Context (language use); Computer science; Cloud computing; Ambient calculus,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/books/collections/thalheim2015.html#BosaHV15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4,,10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4,2232036026,,0,001-818-371-411-333; 003-222-418-546-848; 003-486-035-769-218; 007-347-831-559-305; 008-638-531-729-145; 009-423-571-972-316; 009-479-207-879-927; 009-711-187-161-646; 011-357-043-256-948; 012-083-130-141-859; 012-843-584-257-96X; 014-106-579-715-586; 015-523-397-103-443; 018-165-812-773-447; 018-408-105-437-771; 020-013-882-140-265; 020-055-026-086-767; 020-859-000-477-739; 022-955-585-690-019; 024-774-638-733-220; 025-722-460-405-589; 026-553-478-804-061; 026-689-280-375-460; 027-299-252-797-693; 028-123-482-947-439; 031-680-643-718-507; 032-094-474-773-891; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-172-473-573-484; 039-562-045-588-902; 040-736-326-793-892; 041-863-663-936-741; 042-335-752-162-810; 044-788-529-526-620; 045-645-254-930-664; 047-626-828-795-238; 048-268-389-255-748; 049-295-402-440-578; 049-312-328-998-187; 051-307-262-996-060; 052-152-063-024-042; 053-375-408-597-968; 053-509-613-285-34X; 054-657-127-446-700; 057-174-043-300-23X; 059-553-350-068-285; 059-698-744-526-901; 060-046-569-964-120; 066-917-332-730-659; 069-026-377-296-980; 072-884-492-292-431; 073-258-060-458-846; 075-457-462-368-944; 077-321-006-820-298; 078-622-127-299-350; 079-041-047-051-540; 080-068-232-752-723; 082-093-993-781-083; 084-804-261-938-541; 084-844-298-657-889; 087-622-217-950-860; 089-177-439-212-556; 091-297-766-471-297; 092-195-924-604-606; 093-246-890-080-421; 096-754-613-880-295; 099-788-217-555-735; 100-328-482-174-091; 101-704-045-813-337; 103-893-566-408-482; 105-745-406-603-420; 106-261-727-188-42X; 109-911-943-453-233; 113-740-395-634-754; 115-094-570-598-914; 115-847-630-261-744; 121-657-732-376-374; 122-032-762-876-288; 125-621-317-070-096; 126-039-879-472-196; 129-285-664-028-293; 130-471-786-820-195; 131-199-931-529-377; 138-094-703-131-205; 139-330-264-873-706; 141-503-786-818-995; 142-772-000-932-772; 145-232-410-651-73X; 145-506-276-588-893; 150-285-962-336-711; 157-731-621-681-981; 176-081-343-524-413; 176-491-295-048-855; 180-606-613-543-344; 181-401-889-710-788; 184-044-966-704-362; 186-373-724-498-471; 188-246-181-912-808; 188-780-560-792-746; 189-521-689-083-502; 193-275-642-561-873; 195-635-564-405-355; 195-775-655-598-29X; 199-903-338-991-679,12,false,,

Since such transformations are frequently integrated into design environments, they need to provide short reaction time to support software engineers. The objective of the VIATRA2 (VIsual Automated model TRAnsformations [9]) framework is to support the entire life-cycle of model transformations consisting of specification, design, execution, validation and maintenance. Model representation. VIATRA2 uses the VPM (Visual and Precise Metamodeling) approach [8] for describing modeling languages and models. The main reason for selecting VPM instead of a MOFbased metamodeling approach is that VPM supports arbitrary metalevels in the model space. As a direct consequence, models taken from conceptually different domains (and/or technological spaces) can be easily integrated into the VPM model space. The flexibility of VPM is demonstrated by a large number of already existing model importers accepting the models of different BPM formalisms, UML models of various tools, XSD descriptions, and EMF models. Graph transformation (GT) [3] based tools have been frequently used for specifying and executing complex model transformations. In GT tools, graph patterns capture structural conditions and type constraints in a compact visual way. At execution time, these conditions need to be evaluated by graph pattern matching, which aims to retrieve one or all matches of a given pattern to execute a transformation rule. A graph transformation rule declaratively specifies a model manipulation operation, that replaces a match of the LHS (left-hand side) graph pattern with an image of the RHS (right-hand side) pattern. Transformation description. Specification of model transformations in VIATRA2 combines the visual, declarative rule and pattern based paradigm of graph transformation and the very general, high-level formal paradigm of abstract state machines (ASM) [2] into a single framework for capturing transformations within and between modeling languages [7]. A transformation is defined by an ASM machine that may contain ASM rules (executable command sequences), graph patterns, GT rules, as well as ASM functions for temporary storage. An optional main rule can serve as entry point. For model manipulation and pattern matching, the transformation may rely on the metamodels available in the VPM model space; such references are made easier by namespace imports.",74,,302,324,Transformation (function); Graph (abstract data type); Abstract state machines; Rotation formalisms in three dimensions; Modeling language; Programming language; Computer science; Graph rewriting; Pattern matching; Metamodeling; Engineering; Mathematics education; CONTEST; Model transformation; Instructive case,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4758 https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4758 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/series/eptcs/eptcs74.html#abs-1111-4758 https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.74.25 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1111.4758H/abstract http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4758,http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/eptcs.74.25,,10.4204/eptcs.74.25,2040316112; 3151171642,,0,014-524-248-398-119; 015-152-285-074-887; 057-927-875-552-177; 082-867-331-821-855; 087-102-923-897-658; 189-521-689-083-502; 196-193-318-404-649,2,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

The resulting compiler starts with a textual representation of the specification, and produces a program in the underlying formal calculus (Abstract State Machines, ASM).

This paper proposes a formal description of this trust model by using abstract state machine (ASM).

Thus, the aim of this work is to present a general approach for actor modelling in business processes that supports different layers of abstraction, thereby increasing the expressiveness and avoiding inaccuracy and redundancy. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed actor modelling approach supports task-based assignment of actors and roles based on deontic logic and speech act theory. The semantics of the approach is formally specified based on abstract state machines. Findings – The new approach for actor modelling is more expressive and provides the possibility to reduce the structural complexity of the process flow as shown by a case study and a comparison of an ordinary business process modelling approach using swimlanes and the actor modelling approach based on the workflow resource patterns.

While the multi-cloud system is running in normal mode, data about the execution will be gathered and evaluated by the monitoring component, and in case any critical situation is discovered the adaptation component is alerted.

We present a generic framework that tackles this problem using an incremental approach that interleaves model construction and verification. Our protocol models are based on abstract state machines formalized in Isabelle/HOL. We provide abstract building blocks and generic composition rules to support incremental addition of protocol features to a parameterized endpoint model. This structured approach controls model complexity. We can refine data structures and develop control independently, to create a concrete instantiation. To make the verification effort feasible, we combine interactive theorem proving with symbolic model checking using NuSMV. The theorem prover is used to reason about generic correctness properties of the abstract models given some local assumptions. We can use model checking to discharge these assumptions for a specific instantiation.

This opens the door to the more faithful modelling of many scenarios where digital systems have to interact with the continuously varying physical world. Transitions in the extended framework are thus either moded (catering for discontinuously changing quantities), or pliant (catering for smoothly changing quantities). An operational semantics is provided, first for monolithic systems, and this is then extended to give a semantics for systems consisting of several distinct subsystems. This allows each subsystem to undergo its own subsystem-specific mode and pliant transitions. Refinement is elaborated in the extended context for both monolithic and composed systems. The formalism is illustrated using an example of a bouncing tennis ball.",,,29,62,Mode (statistics); Control engineering; Abstract state machines; Operational semantics; Semantics (computer science); Context (language use); Tennis ball; Formalism (philosophy); Computer science,,,,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/moded-and-continuous-abstract-state-machines(851ab9c0-9f53-430a-8583-bfe77c0d78fd).html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_3 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/boerger2021.html#BanachZ21 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_3,,10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_3,3157881261,,0,001-668-881-085-733; 003-241-938-882-099; 006-555-745-475-703; 008-168-001-665-128; 010-121-126-907-817; 012-427-153-047-386; 019-156-753-656-102; 022-159-974-128-057; 022-955-585-690-019; 023-091-218-039-751; 024-546-887-449-904; 025-394-312-105-365; 025-514-448-365-880; 030-013-186-144-169; 035-472-280-060-118; 037-445-945-364-220; 038-812-259-656-192; 047-921-885-583-567; 052-081-579-438-232; 055-936-391-993-277; 063-340-995-862-940; 063-710-601-298-239; 063-833-206-702-414; 068-711-202-527-571; 069-221-606-842-193; 080-491-897-850-043; 091-025-166-794-309; 096-932-988-256-420; 100-204-993-142-214; 103-488-983-071-893; 113-330-233-645-723; 113-467-147-505-57X; 114-647-089-715-353; 119-528-986-164-23X; 122-743-748-366-020; 123-082-630-503-713; 125-445-807-353-531; 129-385-882-437-35X; 129-967-520-347-12X; 134-197-970-129-173; 134-209-171-650-208; 135-303-591-028-420; 139-330-264-873-706; 139-952-516-075-441; 142-815-734-299-651; 145-255-208-554-188; 152-460-295-626-405; 154-000-910-997-626; 154-550-982-498-232; 167-739-045-209-089; 185-505-011-651-937; 186-076-165-513-653; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls.

Constraints imposed to such systems need to be thoroughly checked in order to ensure a proper service delivery to the client. The current paper proposes a monitoring solution for large-scale distributed systems relying on abstract state machines. Data gathered from the monitoring components are used in calculating metrics and establishing a diagnosis for the system. Emphasis is put on failure detection and on ensuring non-functional requirements of the system such as fault-tolerance and resilience. The model introduced in this paper will be integrated in a cloud-enabled large-scale distributed system. The novelty of the solution consists of finding the best integration architecture for state-of-the-art algorithms and tools and refining them to an efficient version for large-scale distributed systems.,,,219,227,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Emphasis (telecommunications); Face (geometry); Resilience (network); Novelty; Scale (chemistry); Computer science; Scalability; Service delivery framework,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27340-2_28 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/eurocast/eurocast2015.html#Buga15 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/eurocast/eurocast2015.html#Buga15 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27340-2_28,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-27340-2_28,,10.1007/978-3-319-27340-2_28,2397594688,,0,002-115-745-977-450; 004-046-982-476-437; 030-442-759-500-200; 041-863-663-936-741; 059-270-683-857-063; 059-553-350-068-285; 097-355-146-474-99X; 105-768-234-371-847; 109-847-160-864-681; 113-740-395-634-754; 129-773-650-888-279; 131-250-711-018-963; 139-330-264-873-706; 139-824-989-435-586; 147-019-981-692-623; 166-497-074-172-849,3,false,,

029-213-608-013-056,Logical Foundations of Database Transformations for Complex-Value Databases,2010-08-30,2010,book,,,,,Qing Wang,"Database transformations consist of queries and updates which are two fundamental types of computations in any databases - the first provides the capability to retrieve data and the second is used to maintain databases in light of ever-changing application domains. With the rising; popularity of web-based applications and service-oriented architectures, the development of database transformations must address new challenges, which frequently call for establishing a theoretical framework that unifies both queries and updates over complex-value databases. This dissertation aims to lay down the foundations for establishing a theoretical framework of database transformations in the context of complex-value databases.; We shall use an approach that has successfully been used for the characterisation of sequential algorithms. The sequential Abstract State Machine (ASM) thesis captures semantics and behaviour of sequential algorithms. The thesis uses the similarity of general computations and database transformations for characterisation of the later by five postulates: sequential time postulate, abstract state postulate, bounded exploration postulate, background postulate, and the bounded non-determinism postulate. The last two postulates reflect the specific form of transformations for databases. The five postulates exactly capture database transformations. Furthermore, we provide a logical proof system for database transformations that is sound and complete.",,,,,Database theory; Abstract state machines; Database design; State postulate; Semantics (computer science); Proof; Context (language use); Database schema; Computer science; Database; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Database-Transformations-Complex-Value-Databases/dp/3832525637 https://macau.uni-kiel.de/receive/dissertation_diss_00005165 https://macau.uni-kiel.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/dissertation_derivate_00003265/QingWangPhdFinal.pdf,https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Database-Transformations-Complex-Value-Databases/dp/3832525637,,,1587281146,,0,000-752-063-784-183; 000-855-181-978-36X; 001-996-277-886-545; 002-291-495-905-245; 002-438-766-985-114; 002-439-480-560-924; 002-793-522-908-637; 002-801-412-074-886; 003-238-645-299-994; 003-435-477-456-120; 005-814-571-688-772; 007-393-454-906-902; 008-840-598-415-350; 011-052-400-879-696; 011-830-473-005-058; 012-889-560-510-266; 016-183-975-481-912; 016-208-822-747-909; 017-198-523-833-487; 019-928-127-712-91X; 019-990-822-158-858; 021-263-646-371-449; 022-174-461-059-506; 022-841-112-986-332; 023-223-400-630-347; 024-439-760-568-187; 025-221-133-034-80X; 025-382-295-929-240; 026-830-714-409-083; 028-123-482-947-439; 029-858-763-538-985; 031-375-079-132-212; 031-909-553-637-650; 033-207-969-530-714; 034-400-132-510-675; 034-920-696-502-784; 035-172-473-573-484; 035-829-124-181-419; 035-841-919-756-679; 035-889-423-935-983; 036-372-608-343-604; 036-857-749-109-593; 038-014-431-396-278; 038-807-701-463-486; 039-254-383-059-451; 039-461-346-794-31X; 040-613-353-385-886; 041-800-159-830-034; 042-335-752-162-810; 043-578-339-348-489; 044-328-373-269-72X; 044-615-296-813-163; 046-216-399-297-450; 046-333-404-872-302; 046-430-902-868-423; 046-604-679-409-001; 049-568-064-340-531; 049-613-440-159-93X; 050-638-956-461-087; 050-932-375-566-435; 050-995-433-771-903; 052-795-698-812-279; 057-776-656-938-015; 058-327-117-660-758; 059-437-475-149-355; 061-225-206-697-14X; 062-360-840-957-47X; 063-159-111-410-249; 063-956-249-739-620; 064-863-740-912-618; 065-281-817-429-947; 066-288-975-518-599; 066-768-618-769-712; 068-257-256-309-994; 071-447-436-855-189; 074-172-714-846-119; 076-818-214-474-008; 076-969-562-422-894; 077-445-945-450-939; 081-449-314-528-456; 082-391-519-387-578; 082-815-138-851-468; 082-976-047-470-333; 083-385-723-837-13X; 084-818-473-344-910; 085-994-097-594-260; 089-803-198-954-043; 090-042-286-639-141; 090-792-735-730-657; 091-197-359-640-42X; 091-287-206-791-023; 092-195-924-604-606; 097-454-440-007-034; 100-117-771-848-697; 100-610-477-748-918; 100-683-174-205-26X; 104-042-405-996-341; 105-620-622-527-144; 105-802-336-877-837; 105-847-270-652-393; 107-561-736-253-087; 110-896-202-245-827; 113-740-395-634-754; 115-181-157-045-414; 122-107-976-489-666; 122-748-228-161-972; 124-984-484-040-077; 127-274-971-485-965; 128-098-550-928-269; 129-055-044-320-097; 129-109-313-221-099; 130-548-926-406-803; 130-702-070-020-606; 130-765-247-038-042; 132-831-968-463-386; 133-375-412-244-057; 134-793-647-146-265; 136-735-807-967-212; 137-834-586-825-949; 147-500-061-251-762; 149-524-191-041-623; 155-595-721-116-385; 161-581-499-219-980; 161-722-018-758-024; 168-196-175-947-627; 174-270-315-761-227; 194-212-893-256-820; 195-797-762-688-423,8,false,,

For modeling reactive systems, one uses input-output model programs, where the action vocabulary is divided between two conceptual players: the input player and the output player. The players share the action vocabulary and make moves that are labeled by actions according to their respective model programs. Conformance between the two model programs means that the output (input) player only makes output (input) moves that are allowed by the input (output) players model program. In a bounded game, the total number of moves is fixed. Here model programs use a background theory $\mathcal{T}$ containing linear arithmetic, sets, and tuples.

The method allows one to start system development with a trustworthy high level system specification and to link such a ground model in a well documented and inspectable way through intermediate design steps to its implementation. The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most, general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich's Abstract State Machines. Through its versatility the ASM approach is non-monolithic and integratable at any development level into current design and analysis environments.

Main purpose of FALKO is the construction and validation of timetables for railway systems. For simulation the whole closed-loop traffic control system is modelled within FALKO. The railway process model part of FALKO was formally specified using the ASM approach. C++ code is generated from the formal specification and compiled together with the handwritten C++ code of the other components to obtain the FALKO executable. The project started in May 1998 and was finished in March 1999. Since then FALKO is used by the Vienna Subway Operator for the validation of the whole subway operational service.,,,361,366,Operating system; Software engineering; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Executable; Service (systems architecture); Computer science; Component (UML); Software design; Abstract machine; Process (computing),,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#BorgerPS00 http://core.ac.uk/display/22190340 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20,1498334749,,0,020-013-882-140-265; 100-011-765-145-332; 105-620-622-527-144; 191-925-997-526-005,40,false,,

The state of an Abstract State Machine has two components: a behavioural state and a data state. The behavioural states are shown on a state diagram, whose transitions are labelled with an “event” and a B operation. The firing of a transition is synonymous with the occurrence of its associated event. We use a synchronous model of communication based on shared events which simultaneously change the state of each participating machine. The B operation associated with a transition generally has the form G ⟹ S, where a necessary condition for the transition to fire is that G is true, and where S describes any resulting changes in the data state of the Abstract Machine. The paper includes simple examples, the translation of Abstract State Machines to B Action Systems, the translation of Abstract State Machines into “primitive” Abstract State Machines which have only behavioural state, the parallel combination of high level Abstract State Machines, and short notes on choice and refinement.",,,226,242,Formal specification; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; State transition table; State diagram; Finite-state machine; Extended finite-state machine; UML state machine; Computer science; State (computer science); Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0053364.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2FBFb0053364 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/b/b1998.html#StoddartDGS98 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0053364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bfb0053364,,10.1007/bfb0053364,1838372604,,0,034-960-259-700-404; 036-339-321-338-061; 065-200-392-252-180; 108-925-457-506-038; 110-751-465-368-32X; 113-330-233-645-723; 117-821-177-762-731; 151-438-187-317-392,5,false,,

Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation. Furthermore this includes the automatic generation of the associated traceability data and test specification documentation. An initial framework has been defined to support exchangeabiUty of individual tasks in the generation toolchain. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by testing the complete heterogeneous signal communication of an exemplary avionics system, resp. platform instance, at system level as well as at software high-level.",,,1,8,Software engineering; White-box testing; Model-based testing; Keyword-driven testing; Test strategy; Artifact (software development); Computer science; Test data generation; System testing; Test Management Approach,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8080500/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/autest.2017.8080500,,10.1109/autest.2017.8080500,2765445829,,0,050-309-871-652-59X; 074-065-077-648-705; 106-620-223-312-062; 106-871-695-200-890; 118-933-923-879-716; 139-330-264-873-706,9,false,,

While the use of the newly created language is just an additional tool in the established cycle, the language live cycle is independent and opens the doors for the application of formal methods.

Using Abstract State Machines and Montages for the language specification, it was possible that the industrial partners learned how to maintain and extend the language specification.

(b) Hybrid models as sequences of intervals of the real numbers. Discrete events happen where such an interval ends (and, typically, the next one starts) and are assumed to take no time. Continuous changes take place during intervals. Point intervals are used to model consecutive discrete steps without an interveningcon tinuous phase.

However, reasoning about ASM models occurs, not within a formal deductive system, but basically in the classical informal proofs style of mathematics. Several formal veriﬁcation approaches for proving correctness of ASM models have been investigated. In this paper we consider the use of the TLA+logic for the deductive veriﬁcation of a certain class of ASMs, namely basic ASMs which have successfully been applied in describing the dynamic behavior of systems at various levels of abstraction. In particular, we base our veriﬁcation purpose on a translation of basic ASMs to the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) used as a formal basis to formally specify and reason about temporal behaviors of basic ASM models. The temporal deductive approach is illustrated by the formal correctness proof of a producer-consumer system formalized in terms of basic ASMs.",9,1,12,21,Mathematical proof; Temporal logic of actions; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Class (computer programming); Systems design; Computer science; Base (topology); Abstraction (linguistics); Correctness,,,,,,,,,1918659448,,0,,0,false,,

In terms of model-checking, this is a complex task and may result in the well known “state-explosion” problem. These considerations led us to investigate a compositional verification approach which decomposes the system in accordance with its Software Architecture. The architectural decomposability theorem we defined in previous work decomposes the system into three logical layer: (i) application components, (ii) proxies and, (iii) middleware. This logical separation allows for reducing the global system validation to the verification of local behaviors.; ; In this paper, we engineer the architectural decomposability theorem to the analysis of middleware-based applications by automatically generating the proxies needed by the components in order to properly interact with each other via the middleware. In particular, following the Model Driven Architecture approach and by making use of the Abstract State Machine formalism, we describe a set of transformation rules that allow for deriving correct proxies for using CORBA. By means of the proposed transformations, the correctness of the proxy behavioral models is guaranteed without the need to validate them with respect to the assumptions posed by the theorem.",3527,,130,145,Model checking; Distributed computing; Middleware; Abstract state machines; Artificial intelligence; Finite-state machine; Component-based software engineering; Distributed transaction; Software architecture; Computer science; Common Object Request Broker Architecture; Correctness; Metamodeling; Server,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/20733894 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11494713_9 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:795984 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11494713_9 https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11494713_9 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ewsa/ewsa2005.html#CaporuscioRIPP05 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11494713_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11494713_9,,10.1007/11494713_9,145812931,,0,003-222-418-546-848; 019-043-895-820-341; 020-579-587-866-103; 026-133-514-516-438; 030-266-627-017-428; 049-082-894-957-442; 050-630-051-942-859; 054-846-496-589-187; 060-733-812-776-088; 067-598-697-015-843; 082-714-949-563-192; 084-716-077-295-136; 089-230-761-458-263; 100-638-520-723-965; 107-077-171-963-473; 107-105-694-854-482; 124-147-640-963-159; 146-213-823-616-943; 146-579-344-003-185; 155-304-026-125-99X; 171-825-136-193-452; 189-521-689-083-502; 193-963-458-821-064,4,false,,
033-092-785-757-554,ACSW - Evolving concurrent systems: behavioural theory and logic,2017-01-31,2017,book,Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference,,ACM,,Klaus-Dieter Schewe; Flavio Ferrarotti; Loredana Tec; Qing Wang; Wenya An,"A concurrent system can be characterised by autonomously acting agents, where each agent executes its own program, uses shared resources and communicates with the others, but otherwise is totally oblivious to the behaviour of the other agents. In an evolving concurrent system agents may change their programs, enter or leave the collection at any time thereby changing the behaviour of the overall system. In this paper we present a behavioural theory of evolving concurrent systems, i.e. we provide (1) a small set of postulates that characterise evolving concurrent systems in a precise conceptual way without any reference to a particular language, (2) an abstract machine model together with a plausibility proof that the abstract machines satisfy the postulates, and (3) a characterisation proof that any system stipulated by the postulates can be step-by-step simulated by an abstract machine. The theory integrates the behavioural theories for unbounded (synchronous) parallel algorithms, asynchronous concurrent systems, and reflective algorithms, respectively. However, in the latter two theories only sequential agents and sequential reflective algorithms were considered. Furthermore, linguistic reflection has not been integrated with parallelism. We will show how these research gaps can be closed. The behavioural theory implies that concurrent reflective Abstract State Machines (crASMs) can be used as a specification and development language for evolving concurrent systems. We therefore investigate a logic for crASMs. Based on the simple observation that concurrent ASMs can be mimicked by non-deterministic parallel ASMs we exploit the complete one-step logic for non-deterministic ASMs for the definition of a logic capturing concurrency. By making the extra-logical rules in the logic subject to being interpreted in a state we extend the logic to capture also reflection.",,,77,10,Parallel algorithm; Abstract state machines; Asynchronous communication; Concurrency; Concurrent constraint logic programming; Computer science; State (computer science); Reflection (computer programming); Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,Austrian Science Fund,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/acsw/acsw2017.html#ScheweFTWA17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3014812.3017446,,10.1145/3014812.3017446,2561831591,,0,005-808-345-577-571; 006-054-288-393-431; 008-752-451-030-114; 011-409-575-538-040; 016-885-753-288-945; 022-955-585-690-019; 028-123-482-947-439; 029-213-608-013-056; 031-251-901-771-103; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-763-988-083-753; 037-445-945-364-220; 040-160-680-572-188; 046-962-395-496-182; 050-995-433-771-903; 058-974-031-275-841; 062-651-880-332-001; 064-187-299-239-715; 072-130-201-850-819; 085-295-759-056-62X; 092-195-924-604-606; 096-795-544-756-864; 098-944-026-156-091; 110-568-113-192-118; 111-267-725-928-277; 113-740-395-634-754; 123-082-630-503-713; 124-274-196-213-58X; 125-392-303-019-904; 127-079-227-441-119; 135-907-157-457-107; 139-330-264-873-706; 146-598-979-096-673; 151-522-501-802-495; 154-550-982-498-232; 155-008-633-941-159; 155-360-261-561-368; 159-450-590-630-808; 170-129-407-781-972; 179-270-193-306-26X; 185-832-320-961-662; 186-076-165-513-653; 186-126-553-885-590; 187-241-344-225-588; 189-521-689-083-502,15,false,,

To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. For requirements development, especially requirements validation and verification, model-driven architecture techniques can be considered as a cost-efficient solution. In order to utilize such advantages, the design of the proposed system is often specified in terms of analyzable models at the certain level of abstraction. Further, different levels of requirements are translated into verifiable queries and fed into the models to be either validated or verified. For requirements management, requirements traceability provides critical support for performing change impact analysis, risk analysis, regression testing, etc. In this thesis, we cover several topics about requirements validation, requirements verification, and requirements traceability. In particular, the technical contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose an approach to requirements validation by using the extended Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined TASM constructs and, 2) we present a simulation-based method which is powered up by statistical techniques to conduct requirements verification, working with industrial applications and, 3) we introduce an improved VSM-based requirements traceability recovery approach using a novel context analysis. Further, we have demonstrated the applicability of our contributions in real world usage through various case studies.",,,479,484,Software requirements specification; Software engineering; Requirement; Traceability matrix; Requirements management; Non-functional requirement; Systems engineering; Requirements traceability; Computer science; Requirements analysis; System requirements specification,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6912302/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/re/re2014.html#Zhou14 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6912302/ https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/re/2014/3031/00/06912302.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:766880,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/re.2014.6912302,,10.1109/re.2014.6912302,1993303511,,0,003-488-942-167-957; 004-636-959-278-328; 004-902-061-023-096; 011-152-867-796-331; 015-535-316-476-730; 026-600-432-817-130; 028-528-311-609-537; 029-976-533-221-517; 034-813-813-722-433; 052-075-299-095-289; 061-049-015-355-331; 062-388-052-333-935; 070-191-121-764-597; 100-395-847-991-028; 113-558-333-897-785; 119-195-958-861-705; 135-893-367-201-957; 157-828-514-813-96X; 172-080-463-220-529,1,false,,

In order to support the engineering of service-oriented software applications, foundational theories, service modeling notations, evaluation techniques fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach are required. This article introduces a framework for modeling and prototyping service-oriented applications. The framework consists of a precise and executable language, SCA-ASM, for model-based design, and of a tool for early and quick design evaluation of service assemblies. The language combines the OASIS/OSOA standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) capability of modeling and assembling heterogeneous service-oriented components in a technology agnostic way, with the rigor of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method able to model notions of service behavior, interactions, orchestration, compensation and context-awareness in an abstract but executable way. The tool is based on existing execution environments for ASM models and SCA applications. An SCA-ASM model of a service-oriented component, possibly not yet implemented in code or available as off-the-shelf, can be (i) simulated and evaluated offline, i.e. in isolation from the other components; or (ii) executed as abstract implementation (or prototype) together with the other components implementations according to the chosen SCA assembly.

It is centered around memory access patterns. Other than dataflow programming it emphasizes on upholding the sequential modification order of each data object. As a consequence the visible side effects on any object can be guaranteed to be identical to a sequential execution. Thus the set of optimizations that are performed are compatible with C's abstract state machine and compilers could perform them, in principle, automatically and unobserved. We present two separate implementations of this model. The first in C++ uses overloading of the operator[] to instrument the memory accesses. The second in Modular C uses annotations and code transformations for the two nested loops. Thereby the code inside the loops may stay as close as possible to the original code such that optimization of that code is not impacted unnecessarily. These implementations show promising results for appropriate benchmarks from polybench and rodinia.",,,17,24,Nested loop join; Tree traversal; Control flow; Automatic parallelization; Compiler; Parallel computing; Dataflow programming; Computer science; Task parallelism; Object (computer science),automatic parallelization; iterative algorithms; parallel control flow; memory access classification,,,,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01814740/document https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pdp/pdp2019.html#GustedtM19 https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02046105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/empdp.2019.8671575,,10.1109/empdp.2019.8671575,2899151112,,0,006-437-797-403-616; 015-215-234-772-293; 022-380-639-288-857; 023-072-735-910-222; 041-258-401-282-13X; 057-630-620-275-641; 064-729-531-494-512; 083-830-600-977-207; 091-412-028-108-016; 098-205-107-651-706; 106-043-709-992-128; 177-453-997-344-412,0,true,,green

However, at the same time, it is also a classic BPM domain concerned with typical aspects like creation and exchange of diagrammatic process models, elicitation of domain knowledge, and implementing process (models) into organisations and IT systems. Nevertheless, the Abstract State Machine (ASM) concept, a formal and abstract specification means for algorithms, has been and is fundamental and an important cornerstone for the S-BPM community. The first formal specifications for S-BPM has been developed by Egon Borger using ASM means—namely a specification for an interpreter engine for the subject-oriented modeling language PASS, the Parallel Activity Specification Schema. However, for the sake of intuitive and comprehensive use, ASM can be enriched with defining the passive aspects of PASS, namely the (data) structure of process models and data object appearing in the processes. Here it is useful to complement ASM description means with concepts that are better suited for that tasks. This work analyzes how the S-BPM research community has combined ASM with the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to generate a precise, while comprehensible, system specification for the execution of formal, subject-oriented process models. Furthermore, it will be argued why this combination is worthwhile overcoming the weaknesses of both generic and technology independent specification approaches.",,,283,300,Formal specification; World Wide Web; Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Specification language; Computer science; Ontology language; Business process management; System requirements specification; Business process,,,,,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000135023 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/boerger2021.html#ElstermannWFSB21 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16 http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16,,10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16,3167363613,,0,006-928-937-292-054; 007-443-653-464-302; 010-341-905-776-857; 026-476-847-126-74X; 051-207-280-802-006; 069-630-781-497-603; 075-382-664-940-343; 090-813-859-969-15X; 104-225-610-168-168; 107-632-494-069-898; 110-568-113-192-118; 132-920-378-615-866; 139-330-264-873-706; 151-522-501-802-495; 159-101-499-902-15X; 164-485-336-163-635; 189-521-689-083-502; 196-652-929-785-727; 197-358-066-658-712,7,false,,

The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools.",129,,48,71,Machine learning; Problem domain; Abstract state machines; Artificial intelligence; Generative model; Domain (software engineering); Design tool; Model transformation; Feature (machine learning); Computer science; Domain model,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp129.html#StuikysBBZ16 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642316300247 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167642316300247,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2016.03.009,,10.1016/j.scico.2016.03.009,2361385708,,0,000-832-948-223-260; 001-951-076-341-144; 003-196-924-988-132; 004-531-624-554-73X; 007-039-428-197-370; 010-478-133-597-628; 015-973-878-714-534; 017-404-017-406-268; 020-939-178-608-337; 021-597-101-655-847; 025-465-818-532-415; 026-747-648-439-649; 027-267-515-510-281; 028-573-186-660-159; 030-266-627-017-428; 037-045-266-850-46X; 037-591-084-917-633; 039-015-054-930-498; 039-885-754-626-285; 041-164-887-283-062; 041-795-152-371-943; 042-746-239-741-682; 043-071-282-956-244; 044-732-082-196-916; 045-558-584-000-202; 049-219-795-513-509; 049-906-095-828-272; 050-417-979-922-748; 050-876-332-967-825; 052-789-271-092-080; 053-100-342-452-551; 053-564-336-450-619; 059-428-506-326-12X; 059-913-499-259-481; 060-303-334-781-746; 060-310-515-062-260; 061-914-925-388-988; 062-607-174-196-323; 063-477-985-081-398; 063-967-424-439-814; 064-106-853-161-592; 064-841-327-882-235; 068-221-667-315-323; 070-549-461-412-778; 073-246-357-683-050; 073-672-048-687-340; 081-445-060-852-708; 081-473-574-380-443; 081-533-568-202-802; 081-722-071-191-565; 082-147-582-478-101; 084-371-979-787-630; 084-968-250-743-256; 085-886-567-519-217; 086-917-794-921-500; 087-346-067-166-094; 088-628-745-450-740; 092-336-311-871-337; 094-497-106-858-918; 097-936-161-311-705; 098-303-223-910-735; 099-873-833-822-979; 100-992-191-362-370; 101-186-780-889-031; 101-233-066-357-90X; 103-973-783-568-458; 104-010-863-036-237; 105-917-116-002-166; 106-354-814-573-767; 107-261-222-758-69X; 109-886-118-399-239; 113-448-718-787-221; 118-549-461-619-648; 119-133-564-406-984; 119-501-305-692-038; 120-876-468-208-630; 120-887-504-345-67X; 121-095-804-148-273; 121-650-917-721-830; 121-931-878-667-114; 122-569-669-149-174; 122-877-025-628-203; 122-925-636-487-482; 124-050-194-015-94X; 124-887-140-981-987; 125-424-724-258-499; 126-285-316-988-184; 127-181-247-773-103; 129-576-674-651-564; 138-633-479-491-942; 139-108-345-543-795; 139-362-547-931-730; 141-835-272-735-421; 141-851-381-233-180; 143-997-611-879-871; 150-779-614-055-833; 152-555-602-619-910; 152-666-600-437-357; 154-827-165-536-939; 157-128-304-860-293; 159-522-649-669-863; 160-169-654-777-018; 162-957-774-858-429; 169-010-022-755-171; 170-904-762-140-912; 171-528-626-774-486; 173-601-617-422-869; 186-768-193-376-083; 188-901-452-237-962; 191-699-512-618-33X,25,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

Seshia; Natasha Sharygina; Stavros Tripakis,"System modeling is the initial, and often crucial, step in verification. The right choice of model and modeling language is important for both designers and users of verification tools. This chapter aims to provide a guide to system modeling in four stages. First, it provides an overview of the main issues one must consider in modeling systems for verification. These issues involve both the selection or design of a modeling language and the steps of model creation. Next, it introduces a simple modeling language, sml, for illustrating the issues involved in selecting or designing a modeling language. sml uses an abstract state machine formalism that captures key features of widely-used languages based on transition system representations. We introduce the simple modeling language to simplify the connection between languages used by practitioners (such as Verilog, Simulink, or C) and various underlying formalisms (e.g., automata or Kripke structures) used in model checking. Third, the chapter demonstrates key steps in model creation using sml with illustrative examples. Finally, the presented modeling language sml is mapped to standard formalisms such as Kripke structures.",,,75,105,Model checking; Systems modeling; Automaton; Abstract state machines; Rotation formalisms in three dimensions; Modeling language; Programming language; Verilog; Transition system; Computer science,,,,,https://research.aalto.fi/fi/publications/modeling-for-verification(8d4b7c44-3af7-42d5-86aa-df94b470e347).html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_3 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_3 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/reference/mc/mc2018.html#SeshiaST18 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6ct6g021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_3,,10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_3,2803980942,,0,000-367-831-828-986; 001-009-303-388-610; 004-388-465-192-188; 007-087-905-962-167; 007-424-185-667-649; 007-452-541-398-317; 011-402-724-611-845; 011-619-882-351-281; 012-069-577-604-759; 013-179-966-966-01X; 013-582-680-324-61X; 019-043-895-820-341; 020-347-613-188-340; 024-596-875-546-155; 030-869-245-783-410; 034-067-106-462-722; 035-472-280-060-118; 035-717-669-692-765; 035-763-988-083-753; 036-133-914-330-168; 036-922-067-216-568; 041-096-510-414-50X; 042-514-880-176-09X; 043-144-139-685-028; 045-790-163-272-820; 046-466-643-745-270; 053-677-068-278-47X; 057-489-121-505-780; 058-336-668-491-991; 062-812-999-472-452; 075-924-900-912-576; 080-790-650-502-274; 083-606-547-080-532; 086-495-904-264-074; 086-650-434-985-279; 094-201-067-598-571; 095-630-101-474-145; 101-123-184-766-168; 102-285-352-655-466; 103-122-220-961-699; 103-154-094-354-076; 110-568-113-192-118; 114-118-551-710-285; 120-879-907-393-326; 121-331-628-019-932; 123-049-511-718-530; 123-165-571-685-003; 123-360-541-021-787; 125-973-574-785-964; 130-064-264-999-417; 133-516-597-216-242; 141-259-088-806-426; 151-522-501-802-495; 153-103-004-319-829; 153-839-124-331-859; 154-964-213-354-293; 170-579-610-296-815; 174-813-878-581-244; 181-411-989-710-354; 182-686-245-920-227,9,false,,

Logical models are here presented as theories for implementation design on iDevice, with respect to the algebraic structure caused by state transitions. As a simpler design of complex AI, the environmental constraint is captured as a state, where the function applications are available at each state with the transition to the next states. For communication to the state, and function applications at the state, multi-modal logic model may be of use, where the formula or the condition monitors the state. Then interaction availability is significant, expressed in some algebra on the basis of the meaning definitions for formulas (conditions). By the state transition system, URL searching operations are now formally considered as in algebraic structure. The application of predicates to the states is regarded as applications of functions (transforming conditions) such that its algebraic structure may be given.",,,110,115,Algebra; Dynamic logic (modal logic); Operational semantics; Term algebra; Multimodal logic; Classical logic; Intermediate logic; Mathematics; Axiomatic semantics,State Constraint Agent; Interactive Monitoring; Modal Logic and Algebra,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/complexis/complexis2017.html#Yamasaki17,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0006345901100115,,10.5220/0006345901100115,2612327767,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

This problem is known to be an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary multiobjective algorithms are optimization methods to solve such problems. hypervolume is one of the most important criteria that is used to both as solution evaluation and as a guidance for near-optimal selection of a set of solutions called the Pareto front. In this paper, a new hypervolume-based multiobjective algorithm is proposed for driving the Pareto front. To this end, we extend the single-objective Black hole heuristic algorithm based on the adopted ; $$\theta $$; ; -dominance relation to improving the diversity and convergence to an optimal Pareto front. The conflicting objectives are resource utilization, resource cost, and the workflow makespan (completion time). Also to presenting the appropriate scheduling algorithm, we have proven the correctness of the proposed algorithm by providing the behavioral model of the suggested system using model checking tool. For this purpose, we first introduce the behavioral model of the proposed system using Abstract state machine and extract the properties of the algorithm in the form of linear temporal logic.

Each typed ASM can be effectively translated into an equivalent ordinary one.

Specific artefacts are usually developed to complement specification with validation and verification activities. To avoid boresome and time-consuming activities when reusing models, in a model refinement specification process, techniques supporting reusability of formal development artefacts are highly desirable. In this paper, we tackle the problem of defining a technique for automatic refinement of abstract test cases for formal models given in terms of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We present an approach, based on a classical test generation technique exploiting model checking, able to reuse information of test cases obtained at a given level of abstraction in order to define, in an automatic way, the same kind of artefacts at a subsequent refinement level.

The nature of this process is highly structured and allows researchers to anticipate likely concentrations for a variety of regular, daily activities, including criminal offences. This chapter sets out to model and test these theoretical principles. Mastermind represents an interdisciplinary research project in computational criminology jointly managed by ICURS and the Software Technology Lab at Simon Fraser University. Using the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in combination with a multiagent based modeling paradigm, we devise a formal framework for semantic modeling and systematic integration of the theories for crime analysis and understanding crime patterns.

Stärk,We extend the logic for abstract state machines by a read predicate that allows to make precise statements about the accesses of locations of an ASM. The logic can be used to prove security properties of ASMs like that the machine does not read locations containing critical information or that all accesses of the machine to the abstract memory are permitted. The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs. The logic is complete for hierarchical ASMs and still sound for turbo ASMs. It is integrated in the ASMKeY theorem prover.,336,2,343,365,First-order logic; Predicate (mathematical logic); Abstract state machines; Programming language; Automated theorem proving; Predicate (grammar); Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,Abstract state machines; Logic; Access predicate; Secure information flow; Sequentialization of parallel ASMs,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tcs/tcs336.html#NanchenS05 https://core.ac.uk/display/82685251 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397504007790 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82685251.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011,,10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011,1965433750,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 008-638-531-729-145; 016-347-557-587-544; 028-123-482-947-439; 028-506-345-827-164; 033-685-119-299-460; 034-400-132-510-675; 047-716-841-284-351; 050-035-003-144-688; 063-233-629-815-382; 075-867-333-727-447; 078-466-392-576-046; 088-447-800-261-940; 122-149-423-286-67X; 135-363-344-034-158; 189-521-689-083-502,2,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

Siminiceanu; Jonathan Aldrich,"We present a case study on the verification of the design of a commercial multi-threaded task server (MTTS), developed by the Novabase company, used for massively parallelizing computational tasks. In a first stage, we employed the Plural tool, which is designed to perform lightweight verification of Java programs using a data-flow analysis (DFA) framework, to specify and verify the MTTS. We wrote the Plural specification for the MTTS based on the code developed by Novabase, its informal documentation, and our discussions with Novabase engineers, who validated our understanding of the MTTS application. The Plural specification language is based on typestates and access permissions. In a second stage, we developed the Pulse tool, which enhances the analysis performed by Plural, and used the tool on the MTTS specifications. Pulse translates Plural specifications into an abstract state-machine model that captures the semantics of all the possible concurrent programs implementing the given specifications, and uses the evmdd-smc symbolic model checker to verify the machine model. The experimental results on the MTTS specification show that the exhaustive model-checking approach scales reasonably well and is efficient at finding errors in specifications that were not previously detected with the data-flow analysis (DFA) capabilities of Plural.",80,,169,187,Model checking; Semantics (computer science); Concurrency; Programming language; Specification language; Task (computing); Plural; Computer science; Formal methods; Program analysis,Concurrency; Parallelism; Formal Methods; Specification; Verification; Model-Checking; Program Analysis,,,Portuguese Research Agency FCT,http://www.m-iti.org/node/2182 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp80.html#CatanoASA14 http://repository.cmu.edu/isr/972/ http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1966&context=isr https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642313000178 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2013.01.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2013.01.004,,10.1016/j.scico.2013.01.004,1988482081,,0,001-285-536-638-140; 003-674-127-405-399; 009-867-942-461-994; 011-882-730-843-904; 012-558-207-071-243; 016-503-200-820-069; 017-670-032-633-970; 024-471-559-382-823; 026-377-546-708-945; 028-319-750-743-809; 031-800-725-481-666; 033-114-946-117-203; 034-041-831-011-46X; 038-337-480-623-891; 041-129-415-165-304; 046-956-863-588-141; 055-253-694-545-495; 060-028-923-434-466; 062-099-367-224-425; 067-143-528-631-185; 076-689-502-360-12X; 085-573-919-037-645; 086-394-925-709-674; 099-466-373-726-944; 128-995-232-373-720; 132-827-557-546-337; 142-472-289-705-209; 142-694-345-257-193; 160-247-431-740-497; 179-392-125-808-167; 188-986-000-339-189,5,true,implied-oa,hybrid

Using a formal definition of what makes such an algorithm effective, we prove the validity of the Parallel Computation Thesis, according to which all reasonable parallel models of computation have roughly equivalent running times.

038-393-395-130-108,A data-flow approach to test multi-agent ASMs,,2011,journal article,Formal Aspects of Computing,09345043; 1433299x,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),Germany,Alessandra Cavarra,"This paper illustrates the theoretical basis of an approach to apply data flow testing techniques to abstract state machines (ASMs). In particular, we focus on multi-agent ASMs extended with the seq construct for turbo ASMs. We explain why traditional data flow analysis can not simply be applied to ASMs: data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph whereas in this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program’s flow graph. We revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis taking into account the specific, parallel nature of ASMs, and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. In particular, we analyze the role played by different types of terms in ASMs and deal with the problem of terms that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, terms that are shared between several agents, and derived terms. We also discuss what consequences the use of the turbo ASM construct seq has on our analysis and revise the approach accordingly. Finally, we specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria for this class of ASMs and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.",23,1,21,41,Model checking; Data mining; Test case; Abstract state machines; Model-based testing; Control flow graph; Context (language use); Computer science; Data flow diagram; Data-flow analysis,Model-based testing; Data-flow analysis; Abstract State Machines,,,,https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication7718-abstract.html https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00165-009-0134-7 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fac/fac23.html#Cavarra11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7,,10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7,2063949613,,0,000-062-386-336-352; 006-244-045-917-365; 008-505-985-768-799; 014-001-838-392-291; 017-616-691-581-222; 019-727-238-517-403; 020-013-882-140-265; 020-619-446-070-850; 020-922-982-616-644; 021-003-498-716-896; 023-330-932-628-428; 025-234-726-320-353; 036-096-259-695-637; 041-863-663-936-741; 044-748-027-808-63X; 050-309-871-652-59X; 050-468-192-551-533; 060-028-923-434-466; 060-046-569-964-120; 060-776-050-843-781; 073-111-177-402-911; 081-175-355-114-182; 087-804-745-188-678; 090-391-538-360-098; 090-876-580-086-374; 099-774-459-576-718; 100-693-903-913-08X; 105-620-622-527-144; 115-565-554-416-015; 128-269-677-177-769; 139-330-264-873-706; 157-311-554-599-521; 166-958-854-495-162; 171-904-473-379-026; 187-172-669-687-960; 189-521-689-083-502; 194-694-563-937-513; 195-635-564-405-355,4,true,,green

A scenario of a potential attack specifies the flow but not the content of messages. Using scenarios can reduce the number of protocol runs to be explored during attack searching via simulation. The number of runs can be further reduced by minimizing the number of intruder’s generated messages. The intruder’s ability to generate messages is limited by considering: the expected message content and type matching.

The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model checker which is used to formally verify properties of applications developed in IEC 61499 standard. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the formal verification of the IEC 61499 control systems. The paper also highlights the other uses of verification such as portability of IEC 61499 based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard.

A drawback of BPMN, however, is that modality is implicitly expressed through the structure of the process flow but not directly within the corresponding activity. Thus, an extension of BPMN with deontic logic has been proposed in previous work, called Deontic BPMN. Deontic BPMN reduces the structural complexity of the process flow and increases the readability by explicitly highlighting obligatory and permissible activities. In addition, an algebraic graph transformation from a subset of BPMN to Deontic BPMN, called Deontic BpmnGTS, has been defined. The goal of the current research is to show that DeonticBpmnGTS is terminating and confluent, resulting in a globally deterministic transformation. Moreover, the semantic equivalence of BPMN models and the respective Deontic BPMN models is proven based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Thus, DeonticBpmnGTS can be called a trusted model transformation.",14,2,765,793,XPDL; Abstract state machines; Business Process Model and Notation; Business process modeling; Model transformation; Semantic equivalence; Computer science; Graph rewriting; Deontic logic; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-013-0329-5 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-013-0329-5 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-013-0329-5/fulltext.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sosym/sosym14.html#NatschlagerKS15 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10270-013-0329-5.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10270-013-0329-5,,10.1007/s10270-013-0329-5,2072186792,,0,001-060-200-558-561; 010-400-110-717-447; 011-295-924-255-792; 012-802-531-398-688; 017-734-714-003-220; 022-544-716-016-256; 023-792-630-624-874; 031-596-072-494-658; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-203-507-859-560; 035-527-227-974-485; 038-919-766-394-676; 044-694-642-596-113; 044-899-849-454-162; 050-534-243-461-937; 056-058-657-545-675; 063-082-568-129-622; 068-266-001-875-286; 070-420-712-316-821; 073-417-574-948-880; 077-404-807-404-597; 077-798-951-130-222; 078-815-463-965-018; 090-322-004-588-101; 097-097-799-917-63X; 100-445-653-315-059; 100-476-100-633-403; 104-103-504-460-178; 112-079-571-261-470; 120-713-478-517-924; 123-547-604-862-541; 128-997-780-966-323; 139-330-264-873-706; 142-717-966-833-404; 143-051-784-789-201; 143-700-312-054-351; 144-886-226-950-680; 145-631-022-743-200; 147-019-981-692-623; 147-816-203-607-674; 147-884-987-923-345; 148-370-280-880-175; 154-234-404-295-674; 168-612-360-430-056; 176-845-330-682-225; 178-120-074-270-946; 183-838-723-810-302; 189-521-689-083-502; 191-972-117-212-203; 195-241-545-874-103,14,false,,

Song; Sofiène Tahar; Z. Zhou,"The presence of uninterpreted symbols in the logic means that we must distinguish between a state machine M and its abstract description D in the logic. A given abstract description D will determine a machine M for every interpretation ¢. For the purpose of hardware verification we are interested only in finite state machines (FSMs). However, an abstract description will represent infinite as well as finite state machines, since abstract sorts admit infinite interpretations. We call Abstract State Machine a state machine given by an abstract description in terms of MDGs, or equivalently DFs, as explained below. 2.3.1 Represen t ing sets using MDGs . Let P be an MDG of type U--+V. Then, for a given interpretation ¢, P can be used to represent the set of vectors SetCy(P) = {¢ e ~¢y J ¢ , ¢ ~ (~U)P}. In the next section, MDGs will thus be used in this fashion to represent sets of states and sets of output vectors. We shall also see how MDGs can be used to represent relations. 2.3.2 Describing s t a t e m a c h i n e s with MDGs . An abstract description of a state machine M is a tuple D = (X, Y, Z, FI, FT, Fo), where X, Y, Z are disjoint sets of variables, viz. the input, state, and output variables respectively. Let r/be a one-to-one function that maps each variable y to a distinct variable r/(y ) obtained, for example, by adorning y with a prime. The variables in Y~ = ~/(Y) are used as the next-state variables. X, Y and Z must be disjoint from Yq Given an interpretation ¢, an input vector of the state machine M represented by D is a C-compatible assignment to the set of input variables 94 E. Cerny, F. Corella, M. Langevin, X. Song, S. Tahar, and Z. Zhou X; thus the set of input vectors, or input alphabet, is (I)¢x . Similarly, ¢¢z is the output alphabet. A state is a C-compatible assignment to the set of state variables Y; hence the state space is ~¢y. A state ¢ can also be described by an assignment Ct = ¢o~-1 E ~¢, to the next state variables. Fx is an MDG representing the set of initial states, of type U-+ Y, where U is a set of abstract variables disjoint from X U Y U Y~ U Z. Typically, FI is a one-path MDG where each internal node N is labeled by a variable y E Y, and the edge that issues from N is labeled by the symbolic initial value of y, which can be an individual constant, an abstract generic constant, or an abstract variable u E U. It is possible to specify that two data registers have the same value, but that this common value is arbitrary, by using the same u as symbolic initial value of the abstract state variables representing the two registers. Given an interpretation ¢, a state ¢ E ibCy is an initial state iff ¢, ¢ (3U)F~. Thus the set of initial states of the state machine M represented b y D is s1 = {¢ e I¢, ¢ # (3U)Ft} = Set (Fx). FT is an MDG of type (XUY)-~ Y' representing the transition relation. Given an interpretation ¢, an input vector ¢ E q?Vx and a state ¢~ E ~0, a state ¢,t E ~¢y is a possible next state iff ¢, ¢ U ¢' U ¢"" o ~?-I ~ FT. Thus the transition relation of the state machine M represented by D is RT = {(¢, ¢', ¢"") E ffPCx v ~¢ × d,¢ (¢,, r . l ¢ , ¢ u ¢ ' u o y l ) # FT}. FO is an MDG of type (XUY)-+ Z representing the output relation. Given an interpretation ¢, the output relation of the state machine M represented by D is Ro = {(¢, ¢', ¢"") E @Cx X@CyX@Cz I ¢ , ¢ U ¢' U¢"" [= To}. To recapitulate, for every interpretation ~ of the sorts, constants and function symbols of the logic, the abstract description D = ( X, Y, Z, FI , FT , Fo ) represents the state machine M = (~2x,dPy,¢ ¢ dPCz, SI, RT, Ro) with input alphabet @:~, state space @¢y, output alphabet @¢ z, set of initial states $I, transition relation RT, and output relation Ro. 2.3.3 S ta t e explora t ion . Given an abstract state machine description D = (X, Y, Z, FI, FT, Fo) we can compute the set of reachable states of a state machine M ¢ ¢ ¢ = (~x, ~Y, ~z , $I, RT, Ro) represented by D, for any ¢, using the MDG algorithms mentioned above, while at the same time checking that a given condition on the outputs of the machine, the invariant, holds in all the reachable states. The invariant is represented by an MDG C of type W -+ Z, where W is a set of abstract variables disjoint from X, Y, Y', Z and U. (Recall that Fx is of type V -4 Y.) For a given ¢, an output vector is deemed to satisfy the invariant iff ¢, ¢ ~ (3W)C; thus SetCz(C) is the set of output vectors that satisfy the invariant. Verification with Abstract State Machines Using MDGs 95 The procedure, called ReAn for Reachability Analysis, is the result of lifting the algorithm given in [CoBM89b] to the realm of abstract types and MDGs. It can be described by the following pseudo-code: I. ReAn(D, C) 2. R := Fx; Q := Fx; K := 0; 3. loop 4. K := K + 1; 5. I := Fresh(X, K); 6. 0 := ReIP({I,Q, Fo},X U Y,0); 7. P := PbyS(O, C); 8. if P ~ F then return failure; 9. Y := ReRP({L Q, FT}, Z U Y, n); 10. Q := PbyS(g,R); 11. if Q = F then return success; 12. R := PbyS(R, Q); 13. R := Disj(R, Q); 14. end loop; 15. end ReAn; In this pseudo-code, I, N, P, Q and R are program variables that take as values MDGs representing sets of states, and O takes as values MDGs representing sets of output vectors. We will identify the program variables and their values in the following explanations when there is no risk of confusion. Before each loop iteration, R represents the set of reachable states found so far, while Q represents the frontier set, i.e., a subset of SetCy(R) containing at least all those states that entered Setey(R) for the first time in the previous iteration. In line 5, Fresh(X, K) constructs a one-path MDG representing a conjunction of equations x = u, one for each abstract input variable x E X, where u is a fresh variable from the set of auxiliary abstract variables U. The value of the loop counter K is used to generate the fresh variables. This one-path MDG is assigned to I, which represents the set of input vectors. In line 6, the relational product operation is used to compute the MDG representing the set of output vectors produced by the states in the frontier set. The resulting MDG is assigned to O. Then, in line 7, the pruning-bysubsumption operation is used to remove from O paths representing output vectors that satisfy the invariant C. The resulting MDG is assigned to P. In line 8, if P is not F, then the procedure stops and reports failure. We have implemented a counterexample facility that can then be invoked to produce a most general symbolic trace leading to a state for which the outputs do not satisfy the invariant. Examples of such a trace can be found in [ZSTC96]. If P is F, then SetCz(O) C SetCz(C), i.e. every output vector produced by a state in the frontier set satisfies the invariant, and the verification procedure continues. 96 E. Cerny, F. Corella, M. Langevin, X. Song, S. Tahar, and Z. Zhou In line 9, the relational product operation is used again, this time to compute the MDG representing the set of states that can be reached in one state from the frontier set. Note that the MDG Q representing the frontier set is of type U --+ Y, the MDG I representing the set of input vectors is of type U -+ X, and the MDG FT representing the transition relation is of type (XUY) --+ Y~. The result of taking the conjunction of these three MDGs would be of type U ~ (X U Y U Y~), the result of subsequently removing the variables in X U Y by existential quantification would be of type U--+ Y~, and the result of subsequently applying the renaming substitution 7/would be of type U-+ Y. The RelP operation performs these three operations in one pass, and assigns the resulting MDG of type U ~ Y to N. Lines 10 and i1 check whether SetCy(N) C_ SetCy(R) by the same method used in lines 7 and 8 to check whether SetCz(O) C_ SetCz(C). If this is indeed the case, then every state reachable from the frontier set was already in SetCy(R). The fixpoint has been reached and R represents all the reachable states. Therefore, the procedure terminates and reports success. Otherwise the MDG assigned to Q in line 10 represents the new frontier set. Line 12 simplifies R by removing from it any paths that are subsumed by Q, using PhyS. There may be such paths because Q was not computed earlier as an exact difference. Then line 13 computes the new value of R by taking the disjunction of R and Q, which represents the set of states SetCy(R)U Set ¢ (Q), and assigning it to R. In the general case, this procedure may not terminate and may produce false negatives. These limitations are discusses below, in Section 4.2.3 and Section 4.2.4 respectively. 3. M o d e l i n g H a r d w a r e w i t h M D G s A circuit is described at the RT level as a collection of components interconnected by nets that carry signals. Each signal is represented by a variable. Variables denoting control signals have concrete sorts, while variables denoting data values have abstract sorts. We show how various kinds of components can be represented by MDGs through the following examples. The parser in our MDG tools automatically transforms a component predefined in our Prolog-style MDG-HDL [ZhBo95] into its MDG representation. Gates: For gates, the input and output signals are always of Boolean sort. Figure 3.1(a) and Figure 3.1(b) show an OR gate and its MDG representation for a particular ordering of the variables. Boolean MDGs are essentially the same as ROBDDs. Multiplexer: For a two-way multiplexer as shown in Figure 3.2(a), we may have different MDGs depending on the signals being multiplexed. There is a very compact MDG (Figure 3.2(b)) if xl, x2 and y are all of an abstract",,,79,113,Combinatorics; Tuple; State variable; Loop counter; Counterexample; Finite-state machine; Mathematics; Disjoint sets; Invariant (mathematics); Fixed point,,,,,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2,,10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2,84508643,,0,,23,false,,

In this paper an extension of Abstract State Machines by such expressions is introduced and its usefulness is demonstrated by examples of computations on graphs, such as graph factoring and checking self-similarity. In a naive way these high-level specifications can be refined using submachines for the evaluation of the higher-order expressions.

We prove the correctness property that concurrent runs under the transaction controller are serialisable, assuming an Inverse Operation Postulate to guarantee recoverability. For its applicability to a wide range of programs we specify the transaction controller TaCtl and the operator TA in terms of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This allows us to model concurrent updates at different levels of nested locations in a precise yet simple manner, namely in terms of partial ASM updates.

This would help reduce the cost of later redesign activities in case of unsatisfactory performance. This paper presents a novel approach to perform schedulability analysis at the requirement stage using Timed Use Case Maps (TUCM) language. The proposed approach relies on the computation of Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET), resource allocation and scheduling policies. Timing and resource constraints are first incorporated into UCM specifications, then mapped to Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism and implemented in AsmL language, allowing for simulation and schedulability analysis.

This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Another use case for aspect orientation in specifications is the extension of specifications without touching the original ones. The definition of formal semantics for UML profiles without changing the original UML specification is an example for this application. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented with aspect specification.

Gurevich's behavioural theory of sequential algorithms (aka the sequential ASM thesis) gives a partial answer by defining (non-deterministic) sequential algorithms axiomatically, without referring to a particular machine model or programming language, and showing that they are captured by (non-deterministic) sequential Abstract State Machines (nd-seq ASMs). Moschovakis pointed out that recursive algorithms such as mergesort are not covered by this theory. In this article we propose an axiomatic definition of the notion of sequential recursive algorithm which extends Gurevich's axioms for sequential algorithms by a Recursion Postulate and allows us to prove that sequential recursive algorithms are captured by recursive Abstract State Machines, an extension of nd-seq ASMs by a CALL rule.

Due to the fact that the ASM approach defines a notion of executing specifications, it provides a perfect basis for a language, which can be used as a specification language as well as a high-level programming language. However, in order to upgrade to a realistic programming language, such a language must - besides other features - add a modularization concept to the core ASM constructs in order to provide the possibility to structure large-scale ASM-formalizations and to flexibly define reusable specification units. In this paper, the language XASM, which stands for Extensible ASM, is presented. XASM realizes a component-based modularization concept based on the notion of external functions as defined in ASMs. This paper also briefly describes the support environment of XASM consisting of the XASM-compiler translating XASM programs to C source code, and the graphical debugging and animation tool.",,,69,90,Abstract state machines; Programming language specification; Debugging; Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Specification language; Computer science; Source code; Component (UML); Modular programming,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#Anlauff00,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#Anlauff00,,,1525145857,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 008-851-666-443-606; 011-714-899-066-773; 019-043-895-820-341; 028-647-212-633-541; 032-014-692-842-661; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-198-279-045-712; 071-836-356-365-947; 073-111-177-402-911; 077-082-840-416-099; 094-512-586-911-230; 094-993-083-147-832; 104-538-400-674-182; 105-374-125-615-695; 122-334-811-271-036; 138-788-046-637-498; 150-188-119-252-720; 155-219-003-803-384; 168-683-312-771-217; 171-752-315-748-404; 199-626-244-193-753,17,false,,

This is largely due to the intricacy of the analog behavioral intent which cannot be captured purely in terms of logic. In this paper, we show that by using auxiliary forms of formal specifications such as abstract state machines and real-valued functions, called auxiliary functions, as references for AMS assertions, it becomes possible to model complex AMS behavioral properties. In addition, we present complexity results for the satisfiability problem of such specifications. This approach leverages the growing adoption of AMS behavioral modeling in the industry. This paper also shows that the use of auxiliary state machines allows us to separate out the scope of different analog assertions leading to significant performance gains in the assertion checking overhead.",30,10,1446,1457,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Finite-state machine; Programming language; Temporal logic; SystemVerilog; Property Specification Language; Context (language use); Assertion; Computer science; Behavioral modeling; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6022013 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006022013 https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2155065 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6022013/ https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.ieee-art-000006022013 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tcad/tcad30.html#MukherjeeDM11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tcad.2011.2155065,,10.1109/tcad.2011.2155065,2172085120,,0,004-693-778-579-835; 008-288-866-485-595; 009-480-619-967-729; 014-191-999-164-839; 020-964-488-707-538; 027-149-052-724-656; 029-423-760-086-431; 033-154-745-915-395; 035-513-222-784-888; 050-643-305-531-973; 053-230-392-967-84X; 054-855-593-773-933; 084-189-081-678-787; 092-132-423-247-366; 103-856-760-334-269; 116-009-352-671-13X; 125-401-329-313-580; 125-432-947-099-747; 131-998-515-292-359; 134-200-728-374-167; 192-191-233-992-029,15,false,,

Use Case Maps (UCM) is being standardized as part of the User Requirements Notation (URN), the most recent addition to ITU–T’s family of languages. UCM models allow the description of functional requirements and high-level designs at early stages of the development process. Recognizing the importance of having a well defined semantic, we propose, in this paper, a concise and rigorous formal semantics for Use Case Maps (UCM). The proposed formal semantics addresses UCM’s operational semantics and covers the key language functional constructs. These semantics are defined in terms of Multi-Agent Abstract State Machines that describes how UCM specifications are executed and eliminates ambiguities hidden in the informal language definition. The resulting operational semantics are embedded in an ASM-UCM simulation engine and are expressed in AsmL, an advanced ASM-based executable specification language. The proposed ASM-UCM engine provides an environment for executing and simulating UCM specifications.

In particular, an instance of the ASM model has recently been introduced for computing queries to relational databases. This model, to which we refer as the BGS model, provides a powerful query language in which all computable queries can be expressed. In this paper, we show that when one is only interested in polynomial- time computations, BGS is strictly more powerful than both QL and whilenew, two well-known computationally complete query languages. We then show that when a language such as whilenew is extended with a duplicate elimination mechanism, polynomial-time simulations between the language and BGS become possible.

Integrating Object-Z with a more concrete notation is a sound strategy. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce an approach to model-checking Object-Z specifications based on first integrating Object-Z with the Abstract State Machine (ASM) notation to get the notation OZ-ASM. We show that this notation can be readily translated into the specification language ASM-SL, a language that can be automatically translated into the language of the temporal logic model checker SMV.",,,165,184,Model checking; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Specification language; Temporal logic; Object-Z; Computer science; Notation,,,,,,,,,2808767067,,0,,0,false,,

The rendezvous problem is unsolvable in the class of arbitrary connected graphs, as witnessed by the example of the cycle. Hence we restrict attention to rendezvous in trees, where rendezvous is feasible if and only if the initial positions of the agents are not symmetric. We prove that the minimum memory size guaranteeing rendezvous in all trees of size at most nis i¾?(logn) bits. The upper bound is provided by an algorithm for abstract state machines accomplishing rendezvous in all trees, and using O(logn) bits of memory in trees of size at most n. The lower bound is a consequence of the need to distinguish between up to ni¾? 1 links incident to a node. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we focus on the potential existence of pairs of finiteagents (i.e., finite automata) capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degreetrees. We show that, as opposed to what has been proved for the graph exploration problem, there are no finite agents capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees.",,,242,256,Combinatorics; Discrete mathematics; Finite-state machine; Degree (graph theory); Rendezvous problem; Exploration problem; Rendezvous; Mathematics; Node (networking); Connectivity; Upper and lower bounds,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87779-0_17 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wdag/disc2008.html#FraigniaudP08 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-540-87779-0_17 http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~pierref/POSTSCRIPTS/DISC2008.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87779-0_17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-87779-0_17,,10.1007/978-3-540-87779-0_17,1526420573,,0,000-079-107-244-297; 000-954-548-403-516; 002-329-854-148-284; 003-119-524-175-459; 003-251-083-941-178; 004-579-118-034-339; 005-266-271-225-712; 015-453-936-385-371; 016-961-401-024-796; 019-912-985-368-047; 022-482-322-778-417; 023-593-775-041-256; 030-337-110-016-508; 037-175-754-368-66X; 041-469-927-893-963; 043-973-519-772-818; 049-494-985-199-502; 053-290-143-807-321; 053-984-424-595-990; 065-331-493-493-856; 073-490-129-965-413; 075-501-792-335-112; 080-144-590-072-244; 084-346-979-023-097; 085-308-111-844-025; 090-550-723-830-579; 095-375-539-562-195; 110-627-596-964-975; 113-660-503-591-684; 128-538-118-813-303; 145-961-775-283-458; 148-738-681-786-545; 174-517-111-127-111; 189-395-624-585-478,68,false,,

Our focus is on providing guarantees for changing safety goals at runtime (a form of uncertainty) with the employment of mathematically-based runtime analysis techniques from the area of formal methods (FM@run.time).",1269,,395,410,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Software system; Scale (chemistry); Model based simulation; Research community; Focus (computing); Computer science; Resource (project management); Formal methods,,,,,https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/804283 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/182226 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-59155-7_29.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ecsa/ecsa2020c.html#RiccobeneS20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29,,10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29,3085204783,,0,001-833-306-502-090; 006-244-045-917-365; 006-555-745-475-703; 007-318-748-482-113; 007-573-294-174-316; 008-934-244-782-054; 011-298-860-589-104; 012-182-225-373-63X; 013-500-244-308-937; 014-681-314-564-672; 019-113-402-382-947; 034-172-113-754-20X; 035-085-201-399-050; 042-948-378-508-51X; 046-619-832-582-567; 046-838-597-306-588; 067-643-671-325-675; 068-710-809-463-127; 074-005-404-726-279; 074-332-408-277-851; 087-882-692-877-51X; 094-734-717-644-755; 118-344-159-936-803; 120-805-617-467-313; 138-203-276-451-828; 139-330-264-873-706; 164-160-958-762-821; 167-036-940-702-338; 167-896-065-369-695; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,5,false,,

Despite the complexity and the economic significance of such applications, current practice does not always apply robust and well-understood principles. Model driven architecture (MDA) separates the application logic from the underlying platform technology and represents them with precise semantic models. Web application development therefore has potentially the most to gain from adopting such techniques that can offer a greater return on development time and quality factors than traditional approaches. In particular, the paper presents model-driven transformations between platform-independent (conceptual descriptions of Web applications) and platform-specific (Model-View-Controller conformant) models. The design of such transformations is documented (and possibly animated) through mathematically rigorous specifications given by means of Abstract State Machines.",,,475,490,The Internet; Software engineering; Web application; Web application development; Web modeling; Artificial intelligence; Information system; Model transformation; Software architecture; Computer science; Metamodeling; Web engineering,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4869692 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11431855_33 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/caise/caise2005.html#RuscioP05 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11431855_33 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/11431855_33.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11431855_33,,10.1007/11431855_33,1575907844,,0,003-222-418-546-848; 010-193-530-630-533; 014-875-365-850-914; 020-579-587-866-103; 029-212-473-994-71X; 029-943-697-329-478; 051-120-890-728-913; 056-836-429-533-064; 060-733-812-776-088; 068-814-486-659-462; 076-134-667-053-41X; 082-714-949-563-192; 093-727-249-686-126; 098-124-510-044-506; 124-736-384-157-830; 128-777-022-626-405; 138-077-480-096-945; 189-521-689-083-502,8,true,,bronze

The <jats:sc>RATE</jats:sc> approach consists in generating test sequences from ASMs and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. The process follows these steps: (1) model the system as an abstract state machine; (2) validate and verify the model; (3) generate test sequences automatically from the ASM model; (4) execute the tests over the implementation and compute the code coverage; (5) if the coverage is below the desired threshold, then refine the abstract state machine model to add the uncovered functionalities and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach in three case studies: a traffic light control system (TLCS), the IEEE 11073‐20601 personal health device (PHD) protocol, and the mechanical ventilator Milano (MVM). By applying <jats:sc>RATE</jats:sc>, at each refinement level, we have increased code coverage and identified some faults or conformance errors for all the case studies. The fault detection capability of <jats:sc>RATE</jats:sc> has also been confirmed by mutation analysis, in which we have highlighted that, many mutants can be killed even by the most abstract models.</jats:p>",33,2,,,Computer science; Conformance testing; Abstract state machines; Code (set theory); Process (computing); Model-based testing; Finite-state machine; State (computer science); Test case; Protocol (science); Model checking; Programming language; Algorithm; Operating system; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Medicine; Alternative medicine; Set (abstract data type); Pathology; Standardization,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/stvr.1835,,10.1002/stvr.1835,,,0,000-933-179-954-116; 006-245-002-598-653; 009-458-823-413-271; 015-094-671-158-47X; 017-630-670-472-95X; 022-955-585-690-019; 023-096-455-561-474; 024-247-150-276-957; 031-694-731-258-122; 036-741-136-547-852; 041-380-397-639-51X; 044-429-086-738-194; 046-838-597-306-588; 051-415-616-027-784; 057-131-697-849-029; 069-847-035-494-993; 070-640-533-051-762; 074-005-404-726-279; 076-379-837-900-809; 077-546-770-676-268; 082-770-713-727-687; 085-295-365-742-774; 087-871-713-006-614; 089-830-562-955-071; 095-054-711-527-774; 096-593-721-066-122; 096-620-815-332-12X; 102-462-067-418-482; 102-800-154-097-92X; 117-795-919-710-070; 131-670-096-317-822; 139-330-264-873-706; 140-428-830-076-711; 144-740-178-893-789; 146-351-859-518-697; 150-690-476-979-913; 154-550-982-498-232; 170-313-116-663-079; 196-451-456-592-763,1,false,,

Spec Explorer 2010 is an MBT tool that offers a rich set of features allowing for modeling and analyzing software behavior using graphical visualization and automatic generation of test code from models. In this paper, we propose and discuss a set of guidelines to map the core Abstract State Machines (ASM) concepts and constructs into Spec Explorer 2010. We illustrate our mapping approach using examples and features from ASM-based formal specification languages CoreASM and AsmL. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits, the challenges and the limitations of our proposed mapping guidelines.

However such models focus only on semantics of their behaviors and unfortunately not on semantics of actions and their parameters. In this paper, we suggest to extend the STS model, by following the WSMO based annotation for Abstract State Machine. This semantic enhancement of STS so called S2TS will enable to model semantics of internal behaviors and semantics of their actions together with their input and output parameters. Secondly, we will focus on automated generation of data flow (or the process to perform automated assignments between parameter of services involved in a composition). Thus we do not restrict to assignments of exact parameters (which is practically never used in industrial scenario) but extend assignments to semantically close parameters (e.g., through a subsumption matching) in the same ontology. Our system is implemented and interacting with web services dedicated to Telecommunication scenarios. The preliminary evaluation results showed high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",3,04,499,526,Software engineering; Web modeling; Data Web; Semantic Web Stack; WS-Policy; Semantic Web; WSMO; Web service; Computer science; Social Semantic Web; Database,,,,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/towards-a-semantic-state-transition-system-for-automated-generation-of-data-flow-in-web-service-composition(000c3f57-67a0-4949-9f66-a58c9e710941).html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijsc/ijsc3.html#LecueDL09 https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793351X09000896,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s1793351x09000896,,10.1142/s1793351x09000896,2137990303,,0,013-119-661-064-811; 015-968-185-084-991; 023-654-019-864-341; 041-121-914-901-963; 047-862-266-727-392; 055-115-392-749-841; 068-714-908-304-656; 080-048-958-579-757; 092-892-974-125-711; 104-993-957-363-503; 110-336-331-536-342; 110-568-113-192-118; 114-330-865-774-976; 116-740-257-480-071; 119-158-195-987-453; 119-881-648-077-886; 122-233-916-143-513; 128-601-670-988-237; 129-773-650-888-279; 131-200-349-031-106; 132-846-358-775-747; 136-488-278-378-088; 153-335-556-174-472; 175-711-171-861-508,2,false,,

Initially, the user of the method (i.e., a software developer) specifies the system architecture and selects a set of security requirements (in the form of secure information flow properties) that the system must adhere to. The user then specifies each component of the system architecture using UML inspired state machines, and refines/transforms these (abstract) state machines into concrete state machines.

In particular, we base our work on a translation of general ASMs to full first-order temporal logic. While such a logic is, in general, not finitely axiomatisable, recent work has identified a fragment, termed the monodic fragment, that is finitely axiomatisable and many of its subfragments are decidable. Thus, in this paper, we define a class of monodic ASMs whose semantics in terms of temporal logic fits within the monodic fragment. This, together with recent work on clausal resolution methods for monodic fragments, allows us to carry out temporal verification of monodic ASMs. The approach is illustrated by the deductive verification of FloodSet algorithm for Consensus problem, and Synapse N+1 cache coherence protocol; both are specified by monodic ASMs.",,,95,110,First-order logic; Resolution (logic); Decidability; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Temporal logic; Fragment (logic); Computer science; Linear temporal logic; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/20733418 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_8 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24773-9_8 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2004.html#FisherL04 http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~alexei/publications/ASM2004.pdf http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~alexei/publications/ASM2004.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24773-9_8.pdf https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~alexei/publications/ASM2004.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_8,,10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_8,1775836361,,0,003-051-241-040-986; 003-222-418-546-848; 008-638-531-729-145; 016-566-136-015-791; 018-408-105-437-771; 019-043-895-820-341; 019-808-410-775-645; 028-377-471-186-275; 030-266-627-017-428; 031-310-320-156-556; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-114-762-339-381; 035-704-819-286-111; 037-445-945-364-220; 044-748-027-808-63X; 045-534-655-339-005; 052-995-531-322-274; 054-846-496-589-187; 058-456-910-936-204; 064-763-777-395-02X; 070-756-254-676-748; 072-793-837-418-500; 073-258-060-458-846; 077-837-162-556-510; 084-010-145-144-942; 086-223-977-202-166; 086-719-383-366-007; 087-343-383-278-828; 092-195-924-604-606; 100-638-520-723-965; 105-620-622-527-144; 107-077-171-963-473; 107-301-814-667-752; 110-135-808-466-118; 111-076-093-380-650; 115-830-205-501-718; 122-032-762-876-288; 125-786-745-981-772; 126-722-016-583-006; 127-262-921-163-986; 135-014-474-649-251; 136-913-969-663-579; 139-490-676-623-618; 146-579-344-003-185; 151-231-894-669-989; 155-304-026-125-99X; 157-311-554-599-521; 157-541-600-045-196; 176-197-240-615-472; 176-199-176-888-554; 181-494-707-803-365,3,true,,green

Such MAPE patterns have been proposed by means of a graphical notation, but without a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of components interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome these limitations. We present a domain-specific language, called MSL for MAPE Specification Language, to define and instantiate MAPE patterns and to give semantics to some semantic variation points of the equivalent graphical notation for MAPE pattern. We also provide a formal semantics of the language by means of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, an extension of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formalism to model self-adaptation. Such semantics definition comes with an automatic transformation of MSL models into formal executable models, and opens to the possibility of performing rigorous analysis (validation w.r.t. the adaptation requirements and verification of adaptation properties) of MSL models. Moreover, we present our current results toward a (long-term) realization of an MSL-centric framework, where MSL is the notation of a modeling front-end, on top of richer and more specific modeling, analysis, and implementation back-end frameworks. As proof of concept of our approach, we show the application of MSL and its formal support to a running case study in the field of home automation, by modeling an adaptive control of a virtual smart home developed with the OpenHAB runtime platform.",164,,110558,,Semantics; Proof of concept; Abstract state machines; Software design pattern; Pattern language; Executable; Programming language; Specification language; Computer science; Notation; Home automation; Semantics of logic,,,,Linnéuniversitetet; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions; Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/182222 https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/1132754 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jss/jss164.html#ArcainiMRS20 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220300406 https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/800001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.110558,,10.1016/j.jss.2020.110558,3006891948,,0,003-961-562-160-009; 007-382-485-270-026; 010-687-025-775-176; 014-433-375-269-260; 019-113-402-382-947; 021-363-677-036-393; 032-995-100-169-946; 033-900-257-525-98X; 040-736-326-793-892; 046-384-098-397-303; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-882-823-344-051; 053-014-255-201-040; 056-447-502-642-234; 056-856-322-909-445; 063-885-323-787-802; 069-107-782-970-793; 071-669-167-146-571; 074-332-408-277-851; 076-156-771-799-411; 078-465-195-082-405; 079-912-734-373-841; 083-148-258-422-027; 085-278-493-726-942; 089-501-743-081-273; 090-804-764-766-697; 093-069-711-580-072; 099-943-874-354-121; 117-795-919-710-070; 131-674-931-603-442; 131-836-227-316-887; 140-104-197-656-313; 148-286-190-701-960; 150-070-116-117-175; 167-036-940-702-338; 181-401-889-710-788,19,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,green
049-144-423-264-966,Operational Semantics for Timed Systems: A Non-standard Approach to Uniform Modeling of Timed and Hybrid Systems,2005-04-04,2005,book,,,,,Heinrich Rust,"This monograph is dedicated to a novel approach for uniform modelling of timed and hybrid systems. Heinrich Rust presents a time model which allows for both the description of discrete time steps and continuous processes with a dense real-number time model. The proposed time model is well suited to express synchronicity of events in a real-number time model as well as strict causality by using uniform discrete time steps. Thus it integrates and reconciles two views of time that are commonly used separately in di?erent application domains. In many discrete systems time is modelled by discrete steps of uniform length, in continuous systems time is seen as a dense ?ow. Themainideatointegratethesedi?erentviewsisadiscretizationofthedense real-number time structure by using constant in?nitesimal time steps within each real-number point in time. The underlying mathematical structure of this time model is based on concepts of Non-standard Analysis as proposed by Abraham Robinson in the 1950s. The discrete modelling, i.e., the descr- tion of sequential discrete algorithms at di?erent abstraction levels, is done with Abstract State Machines along the formalisms developed by Yuri Gu- vich and temporal logic. These ingredients produce a rich formal basis for describing a large variety of systems with quantitative linear time prop- ties, by seamless integration, re?nement and embedding of continuous and discrete models into one uniform semantic framework called""Non-standard Timed Abstract State Machines""(NTASM).",,,,,Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Operational semantics; Temporal logic; Time complexity; Computer science; Hybrid system; Discrete time and continuous time; Discrete modelling; Discrete system,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-32008-1 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-32008-1 https://www.amazon.com/Operational-Semantics-Timed-Systems-Non-standard/dp/3540255761 https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3480270M/Operational_semantics_for_timed_systems http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA71809173,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-32008-1,,,1566982456,,0,,8,false,,

At the software architecture level, designers combine subsystems into complete systems using different techniques, e.g. ""Architecture Description Languages"" (ADLs). There exists a number of ADLs, each of which is specialized for one or more architectural styles. They are designed by different research groups with different goals in mind corresponding to their mental model on how software architecture can be expressed in the most efficient and elegant way. As a result, ADLs are not compatible with each other, so that it is diffcult to present a homogeneous view of the software architecture of a system assembled from different components.

The theory is motivated by the development of a verified flash file system. Different components of the system are modeled as submachines and refined individually. We define a non-atomic semantics that is suitable for considering power cuts in the middle of operations. We prove that refinement is compositional with respect to submachines and crashes. We give a criterion “crash-neutrality” and corresponding proof obligations that are sufficient to reduce non-atomic reasoning to standard pre/post verification in the context of power failures in file systems.,131,,3,21,Modular design; Abstract state machines; Crash; Semantics (computer science); Flash file system; Development (topology); Context (language use); Computer science; Theoretical computer science,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp131.html#ErnstPSR16 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167642316300181 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642316300181,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2016.04.009,,10.1016/j.scico.2016.04.009,2346404651,,0,001-639-981-133-816; 002-207-620-160-488; 004-663-195-433-108; 005-005-047-442-83X; 006-576-543-411-085; 010-241-397-894-073; 014-252-513-147-374; 016-885-753-288-945; 022-884-052-207-375; 022-955-585-690-019; 023-925-425-086-751; 030-163-063-026-49X; 030-920-587-764-616; 036-513-318-017-25X; 038-198-267-781-201; 039-020-469-325-034; 040-343-011-638-516; 044-316-489-643-877; 046-261-340-778-973; 055-736-834-842-683; 058-493-773-217-053; 059-511-214-006-850; 073-111-177-402-911; 079-037-053-045-989; 079-138-092-275-27X; 080-491-897-850-043; 083-333-249-285-31X; 086-623-203-101-233; 092-864-353-369-635; 110-568-113-192-118; 114-389-716-490-263; 115-266-437-742-954; 116-142-032-632-361; 118-958-950-945-388; 126-650-758-092-281; 142-653-298-375-689; 154-000-910-997-626; 159-450-590-630-808; 185-832-320-961-662; 186-076-165-513-653; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-548-656-913-554; 199-657-913-669-336,16,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

For a complete definition of a DSL, both syntactic and semantic aspects of the language have to be specified. Metamodeling environments support syntactic definition issues, but they do not provide any help in defining the semantics of metamodels, which is usually given in natural language. In this chapter, the authors present an approach to formally define the semantics of metamodel-based languages. It is based on a translational technique that hooks to the language metamodel its precise and executable semantics expressed in terms of the Abstract State Machine formal method. The chapter also shows how different techniques can be used for formal analysis of models (i.e., instance of the language metamodel).

The development process starts from a high level formal view of the system and, through refinement, derives more detailed models till the desired level of specification. Along the process, different validation and verification activities are available, as simulation, model review, and model checking. Moreover, each refinement step can be proved correct using an SMT-based approach. As last step of the refinement process, a Java implementation can be developed and linked to the formal specification. The correctness of the implementation w.r.t. its formal specification can be proved by means of model-based testing and runtime verification. The process is exemplified by using a Landing Gear System as case study.",19,2,247,269,Model checking; Formal verification; Formal specification; Verification and validation of computer simulation models; Refinement; Programming language; Runtime verification; Computer science; Correctness; Formal methods,,,,,https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/abzsi_sttt15.pdf https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10009-015-0394-x https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/373617 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10009-015-0394-x https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sttt/sttt19.html#ArcainiGR17 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10009-015-0394-x.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10009-015-0394-x/fulltext.html https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/50048 https://core.ac.uk/download/187949947.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10009-015-0394-x,,10.1007/s10009-015-0394-x,1046642269,,0,003-986-545-986-862; 004-397-770-909-434; 004-873-635-327-153; 005-172-918-962-960; 006-244-045-917-365; 013-627-617-866-121; 019-923-593-407-936; 021-003-498-716-896; 022-955-585-690-019; 032-354-281-297-321; 034-226-946-420-66X; 038-079-624-756-003; 038-812-259-656-192; 040-713-725-402-842; 040-736-326-793-892; 041-517-722-797-71X; 041-863-663-936-741; 041-911-347-155-269; 046-619-832-582-567; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-299-736-589-511; 048-673-922-589-260; 052-284-021-464-888; 059-553-350-068-285; 060-430-936-879-339; 061-894-295-420-641; 062-561-989-848-248; 071-634-296-746-266; 074-907-937-829-214; 076-895-921-903-309; 083-083-948-326-126; 085-278-493-726-942; 087-990-696-860-270; 094-734-717-644-755; 099-943-874-354-121; 103-285-966-249-936; 116-882-509-793-976; 118-434-047-948-841; 123-082-630-503-713; 130-927-088-461-327; 135-644-873-316-514; 139-330-264-873-706; 154-000-910-997-626; 154-550-982-498-232; 155-304-026-125-99X; 163-008-439-169-775; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-635-564-405-355,31,true,,green

One main difference to data refinement is that ASM refinement considers infinite runs and termination. Since backward simulation does not preserve termination in general, the standard technique of adding history information to the concrete level is not applicable. The powerset construction also adds infinite runs and is therefore not applicable too. This paper shows that a completeness proof is nevertheless possible by adding infinite prophecy information, effectively moving nondetermism to the initial state. Adding such prophecy information can be done on the semantic level, but also by a simple syntactic transformation that removes the choose construct of ASMs. The completeness proof is also ported to give a completeness proof for IO automata.",214,,25,49,Automaton; Transformation (function); Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Completeness (order theory); Simple (abstract algebra); Construct (python library); Computer science; State (computer science),refinement; completeness; abstract state machines; IO automata,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/entcs/entcs214.html#Schellhorn08 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066108003460 https://core.ac.uk/display/81202349,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2008.06.003,,10.1016/j.entcs.2008.06.003,2095211351,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 008-703-172-083-503; 015-203-426-052-778; 017-436-380-476-259; 019-070-364-259-296; 019-156-753-656-102; 022-955-585-690-019; 025-983-520-104-880; 026-909-635-119-83X; 036-655-680-064-79X; 040-216-749-039-446; 041-849-666-426-519; 043-306-130-978-579; 046-323-920-158-771; 053-079-247-067-977; 056-487-414-753-82X; 062-813-380-338-385; 065-369-456-390-413; 071-435-929-155-510; 080-491-897-850-043; 083-187-716-670-274; 084-392-463-031-27X; 084-706-046-661-106; 085-295-759-056-62X; 102-345-925-433-986; 105-620-622-527-144; 118-896-053-772-586; 118-958-950-945-388; 120-344-022-077-245; 126-650-758-092-281; 141-490-359-931-352; 142-653-298-375-689; 154-000-910-997-626; 157-311-554-599-521; 161-215-557-312-826; 176-197-240-615-472; 183-377-981-512-798; 184-044-966-704-362; 185-832-320-961-662; 189-521-689-083-502,11,true,,gold

052-389-506-702-136,DISC - Proving atomicity: an assertional approach,,2005,book chapter,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,03029743; 16113349,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Germany,Gregory Chockler; Nancy Lynch; Sayan Mitra; Joshua A. Tauber,"Atomicity (or linearizability) is a commonly used consistency criterion for distributed services and objects. Although atomic object implementations are abundant, proving that algorithms achieve atomicity has turned out to be a challenging problem. In this paper, we initiate the study of systematic ways of verifying distributed implementations of atomic objects, beginning with read/write objects (registers). Our general approach is to replace the existing operational reasoning about events and partial orders with assertional reasoning about invariants and simulation relations. To this end, we define an abstract state machine that captures the atomicity property and prove correctness of the object implementations by establishing a simulation mapping between the implementation and the specification automata. We demonstrate the generality of our specification by showing that it is implemented by three different read/write register constructions: the message-passing register emulation of Attiya, Bar-Noy and Dolev, its optimized version based on real time, and the shared memory register construction of Vitanyi and Awerbuch. In addition, we show that a simplified version of our specification is implemented by a general atomic object construction based on the Lamport’s replicated state machine algorithm.",,,152,168,Automaton; Shared memory; Abstract state machines; Atomicity; Programming language; Linearizability; Computer science; State machine replication; Correctness; Object (computer science); Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11561927_13 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/proving-atomicity-an-assertional-approach http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Mitra/disc05.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/11561927_13 http://people.csail.mit.edu/mitras/research/disc05.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wdag/disc2005.html#ChocklerLMT05 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11561927_13 http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/30559 http://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/research/2005/disc05.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11561927_13,,10.1007/11561927_13,2115031960,,0,001-209-906-685-469; 007-089-314-212-558; 009-667-186-300-039; 013-075-925-426-66X; 013-313-541-495-309; 013-487-664-871-634; 016-492-451-541-987; 018-447-056-059-269; 019-955-025-840-631; 021-558-169-329-202; 021-587-052-290-992; 025-213-638-195-334; 025-811-569-298-195; 026-728-699-477-932; 029-163-159-312-364; 033-499-974-811-200; 035-767-539-989-224; 037-445-945-364-220; 039-081-555-397-527; 043-634-825-865-231; 046-801-691-868-940; 051-630-301-964-548; 051-991-653-641-893; 052-139-597-027-129; 060-217-866-981-30X; 069-504-056-297-468; 072-759-679-423-697; 074-338-385-560-079; 074-519-997-619-708; 092-288-600-151-842; 093-098-850-374-888; 101-038-405-948-736; 103-686-737-308-653; 130-469-360-531-019; 138-154-350-682-002; 145-730-989-541-258; 154-493-892-036-183; 184-699-105-896-97X,12,true,,green

As a basic tool we introduce a ‘modal’ logic of transition rules and runs, which is, in the context of evolving algebras, just a definitional extension of ordinary first order logic. A notion of independence of rules and runs enables us to introduce a notion of (and notation for) concurrent runs, on which a logical theory of (‘true’) concurrency may be based. The notion of concurrent run also has (but does not depend on) an interleaving interpretation. Some basic constructs (concurrent composition, addition of guards and updates) and some derived constructs (internal and external choice, sequential composition) on evolving algebras are introduced and investigated. The power of the framework is demonstrated by developing simple and transparent evolving algebra models for the Chemical Abstract Machine of Berry and Boudol and for the π-calculus of Milner. Their respective notions of parallelism map directly and faithfully to native concurrency of evolving algebras.",,,182,215,First-order logic; Discrete mathematics; Computational logic; Dynamic logic (modal logic); Modal μ-calculus; Concurrency; Interior algebra; Multimodal logic; Mathematics; Linear temporal logic; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-56992-8_13 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/csl/csl92.html#GlavanR92 https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13 https://core.ac.uk/display/23268301 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13,,10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13,1503754652,,0,009-175-578-084-557; 015-964-147-887-074; 018-689-712-347-616; 055-832-141-101-145; 059-367-156-907-824; 061-894-295-420-641; 066-917-332-730-659; 071-499-992-964-807; 073-039-171-325-771; 086-879-408-382-912; 114-591-247-923-343; 131-199-931-529-377; 132-920-378-615-866; 135-825-815-246-020; 147-500-061-251-762; 179-537-609-486-445,27,false,,

They combine advantages of informal and formal methods. Applications of this method motivate a number of computability and decidability problems connected to ASMs. Such problems result for example from the area of verifying properties of ASMs. Their high expressive power leads rather directly to undecidability respectively uncomputability results for most interesting problems in the case of unrestricted ASMs. Consequently, it is rather natural to ask whether there exist expressive classes of ASMs for which we can prove positive decidability and computability results. In this work, we introduce such a class of ASMs. The concept is similar to the one of the guarded fragment of first-order logic. We analyze the expressive power of this class and prove that it is stronger than Datalog LITE and the guarded fragment of first-order fixed point logic.

The distributed ASMs that underpin the SDL semantics are defined in terms of agents that execute ASM programs concurrently, acting on partial views of a global state. The discrete identities of successive global states are ensured by allowing input from the external world only between steps, and by having all agents refer to an external global time. But distributed systems comprising independent agents do not have a natural global time. Nor do they have natural global states. This paper takes well-known concepts from relativity and applies them to ASMs. The spacetime in which an ASM exists and moves is defined, and some properties that must be preserved by transformations of the frame of reference of an ASM are identified. Practical implications of this approach are explored through reservation and web service examples.",,,105,120,Spacetime; Abstract state machines; Theory of relativity; Programming language; Reservation; Global time; Practical implications; Web service; Computer science; Frame of reference; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sam/sam2012.html#Sherratt12 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-36757-1_7 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7,,10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7,1607441964,,0,005-919-900-156-170; 016-799-163-937-887; 022-955-585-690-019; 024-439-760-568-187; 059-804-639-548-953; 071-908-704-083-293; 079-933-863-590-861; 092-195-924-604-606; 101-704-045-813-337; 105-620-622-527-144; 111-567-034-049-446; 113-740-395-634-754; 133-375-412-244-057; 139-330-264-873-706; 159-279-984-641-596; 189-521-689-083-502,1,false,,

However, for a family of systems that can be easily decomposed in sub-systems, we devise a technique to cope with this problem. To model such systems, we introduce the notion of sequential net of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which represents a system constituted by a set of ASMs such that only one ASM is active at every time. Given a net of ASMs, we first generate a test suite for every ASM in the net, then we combine the tests in order to obtain a test suite for the entire system. We prove that, under some assumptions, the technique preserves coverage of the entire system.

Hence, it is desirable to find a proper solution to specify different systems through these architectures. Abstract state machine (ASM) is a useful means to visually and formally model pub-sub and event-based architectures. However, modeling per se is not enough since the designers want to be able to verify the designed models. As the model checking is a proper approach to verify software and hardware systems, in this paper, we present an approach to verify ASM models specified in terms of Asmeta language using Bogor-a well known model checker. In our approach, the AsmetaL specification is automatically encoded to BIR, the input language of the Bogor.

They should abstract irrelevant details and provide a precise and complete description of the behaviour of the system. This view of software specification can naturally be expressed by means of Gurevich’s Abstract State Machines (ASMs). There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi) automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We describe, in the form of examples, an abstraction process which starts by extracting an initial ground-level ASM specification from Java source code (with the same core functionality), and ends in a high-level ASM specification at the desired level of abstraction.

The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs.

John Koo,"In many safety-critical applications of embedded systems, the system dynamics exhibits hybrid behaviors. To enable automatic analysis of these embedded systems, many analysis tools have been developed based on hybrid automata model. These tools are constructed by their own domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) but they are different in various aspects. To enable meaningful semantic interpretation of DSMLs, we propose an infrastructure for semantic anchoring that facilitates the transformational specification of DSML semantics. In the semantic anchoring infrastructure, the semantics of a DSML can be anchored to a well-defined semantic unit, which captures the operational semantics of hybrid automaton, via model transformation. The Abstract State Machine (ASM) is used as the underlying formal framework for the semantic unit. The semantics of a DSML is defined by specifying the transformation between the abstract syntax metamodel of the DSML and that of the semantic unit. The infrastructure can also enable model exchange among DSMLs while referring to the common semantic unit. Hence, hybrid automata based DSMLs can be integrated to form a meaningful tool chain by deploying this proposed infrastructure. In this paper, we demonstrate how effective the tool-chain infrastructure is by considering a practical case study involving the hybrid automata DSMLs, HyVisual and ReachLab.",,,523,537,Semantics; Embedded system; Operational semantics; Semantic interpretation; Hybrid automaton; Semantic analysis (machine learning); Model transformation; Computer science; Hybrid system; Abstract machine,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11901914_38 http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/188709 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/atva/atva2006.html#SuHCK06 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11901914_38 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%252F11901914_38.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/38030385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11901914_38,,10.1007/11901914_38,1793318143,,0,000-237-471-278-419; 013-352-634-535-287; 030-207-024-018-878; 035-472-280-060-118; 051-554-773-407-553; 054-422-263-701-693; 055-688-464-605-619; 055-936-391-993-277; 056-769-592-599-269; 076-767-312-466-020; 080-984-743-299-207; 081-022-867-996-249; 091-166-939-396-206; 105-022-405-477-152; 133-366-976-762-787; 185-182-705-894-374,3,false,,

Studies have revealed that most of the anomalies, discovered in the development of complex systems, belong to requirement and specification phases. To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. Model-based techniques, enabling formal semantics and requirements traceability, are emerging as promising solutions to cost-effective requirements validation. In these techniques, the functional behaviors derived from lower-level requirements are specified in terms of analyzable models at a certain level of abstraction. Further, upper-level requirements are formalized into verifiable queries and/or formulas. Meanwhile, trace links between requirements at various levels of abstraction as well as between requirements and subsequent artifacts (such as verifiable queries and/or formulas, and analyzable models) are built, through which the queries and/or formulas can be fed into the corresponding models. However, such model-based techniques suffer from some limitations, such as how to support semi- or fully-automatic trace links creation between diverse development artifacts, how to ease the demand of heavy mathematics background knowledge to specify queries and/or formulas, and how to analyze models without encountering the state explosion problem. In this thesis, we cover two aspects centering around requirements validation to ease the aforementioned limitations, which are mainly about requirements traceability and model-based requirements validation. In particular, the technical contributions are four-fold: 1) we have introduced an improved VSM-based requirements traceability creation/recovery approach using a novel context analysis and, 2) we have proposed a lightweight model-based approach to requirements validation by using the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined Observer and Event constructs and, 3) we have combined our model-based approach with a restricted use case modeling approach for feature-oriented requirements validation and, 4) we have improved the Observer construct of TASM via proposing a new observer specification logic to facilitate the observer specification, as well as defining the corresponding observer execution process. Finally, we have demonstrated the applicability of our contributions in real world usage through various applications.",,,428,436,Software requirements specification; Software engineering; Requirement; Abstract state machines; Requirements management; Non-functional requirement; Requirements traceability; Computer science; Requirements analysis; System requirements specification,feature-oriented requirements modeling; modelbased requirements validation; eTASM; RUCM; software product lines; systems functional behaviors and non-functional properties,,,,https://www.es.mdh.se/pdf_publications/3614.pdf https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6912294/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/re/re2014.html#ZhouLLLKL14 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:743960 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6912294/ https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/re/2014/3031/00/06912294.pdf http://swepub.kb.se/bib/swepub:oai:DiVA.org:mdh-25875 http://mdh.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:743960/FULLTEXT01.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/re.2014.6912294,,10.1109/re.2014.6912294,2125551606,,0,003-196-924-988-132; 003-909-414-002-641; 013-302-746-644-458; 014-495-099-070-581; 021-987-892-822-296; 023-390-146-910-412; 027-607-656-943-847; 031-965-323-329-405; 043-660-291-376-677; 046-438-940-022-329; 049-333-434-225-156; 050-039-015-679-071; 059-825-679-645-486; 064-129-322-305-827; 085-207-918-755-442; 098-524-596-609-071; 098-609-399-253-400; 103-973-783-568-458; 139-573-023-308-243; 147-032-463-627-57X; 151-011-214-641-997; 165-808-911-630-771; 191-699-512-618-33X,19,true,,green

This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for formal modeling, validating, and verifying distributed self-adaptive systems. We show how MAPE-K loops for self adaptation can be naturally specified in an abstract stateful language like Abstract State Machines. In particular, we exploit the concept of multi-agent Abstract State Machines to specify decentralized adaptation control by using MAPE computations. We support techniques for validating and verifying adaptation scenarios, and getting feedback of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the MAPE-K loops. In particular, a verification technique based on meta-properties is proposed to allow discovering unwanted interferences between MAPE-K loops at the early stages of the system design.

ASMs can be used to faithfully capture the abstract structure and step-wise behaviour of any discrete systems. An easy way to understand ASMs is to see them as defining a succession of states that may follow an initial state. We present a machine-executable model for an Intelligent Vehicle Control System, implemented in the specification language AsmL. Executable specifications are descriptions of how software components work. AsmL is capable of describing the evolving state of asynchronous, concurrent systems, such as agent - based systems. The mathematical background for the intelligent control of vehicles is represented by the stochastic automata. A stochastic automaton can perform a finite number of actions in a random environment. When a specific action is performed, the environment responds by producing an environment output that is stochastically related to the action. This response may be favourable or unfavourable.

The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms.In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. In addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first-order structures.The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every other tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set.",649,,25,53,Tuple; Parallel algorithm; Algebra; Class (set theory); Abstract state machines; Set (abstract data type); Finite model theory; Multiset; Bounded function; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,"Austrian Science Fund; Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, and the Province of Upper Austria",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304397516304212 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2016.08.013 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06203 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06203.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397516304212 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1504.html#FerrarottiSTW15 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150406203F/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06203 http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06203,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2016.08.013,,10.1016/j.tcs.2016.08.013,2100307158,,0,002-438-766-985-114; 034-400-132-510-675; 040-160-680-572-188; 041-833-409-225-349; 050-309-871-652-59X; 050-995-433-771-903; 072-612-936-667-38X; 077-321-006-820-298; 081-636-877-588-544; 082-411-428-706-161; 082-815-138-851-468; 092-195-924-604-606; 100-683-174-205-26X; 106-871-695-200-890; 113-740-395-634-754; 128-116-118-415-25X; 136-904-738-110-745; 137-292-579-653-532; 189-521-689-083-502,44,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,green

Despite there being many ISAs in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of robust ISAs by the formal construction of all normal and exception conditions for each instruction.

This paper describes a project to use the Rodin tool-set (Abrial in Formal methods and software engineering, Springer, Berlin, 2006) to perform such a process, ultimately producing two variants of the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) ISA (Wright in Abstract state machines, B and Z, Springer, Berlin, 2007; Wright in MIDAS machine specification, Bristol University, http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications, 2009) as VMs. The abstract model is incrementally refined to variant models capable of automatic translation to C source code, which this is compiled to create useable VMs. These are capable of running binary executables compiled from high-level languages such as C (Kernighan and Ritchie in The C programming language, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1988), and compilers targeted to each variant allow demonstration programs to be executed on them.",23,1,73,89,Abstract state machines; Executable; Compiler; Programming language; Instruction set; Construct (python library); Computer science; Source code; Formal methods; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00165-009-0142-7 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00558085 http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/using-eventb-to-construct-instruction-set-architectures(2c26dc9e-b603-43ca-b9f4-b3d95800c5a1).html https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kerstin_Eder/publication/220102226_Using_Event-B_to_construct_instruction_set_architectures/links/02e7e5182769c22145000000.pdf https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00558085/document https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fac/fac23.html#WrightE11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0142-7,,10.1007/s00165-009-0142-7,2056323061,,0,000-186-604-590-784; 007-117-320-827-845; 015-370-565-519-671; 024-960-737-828-662; 027-555-201-171-922; 032-396-566-769-244; 032-721-977-257-370; 038-074-356-278-830; 038-717-004-318-09X; 041-863-663-936-741; 047-299-736-589-511; 050-021-874-788-190; 053-747-161-316-224; 061-949-328-908-017; 064-875-077-835-887; 067-577-825-112-873; 107-470-550-335-574; 113-330-233-645-723; 119-255-311-275-416; 120-395-919-871-849; 120-587-910-077-450; 124-872-037-902-10X; 138-950-250-871-92X; 140-333-751-089-432; 150-394-553-502-857; 164-979-546-210-778; 165-854-476-287-020; 171-315-664-667-914; 179-262-552-060-32X; 183-377-981-512-798; 186-076-165-513-653; 187-352-813-185-518; 198-523-771-281-538,5,false,,

We introduce Abstract State Machine Nets (ASM Nets) whose component ASMs can be defined using a simple combination of textual (data-oriented) and intuitive graphical (control-flow oriented) yet semantically rigorously defined descriptive means. This allows the BP experts to design BPMs whose underlying ASM Nets constitute a reliable precise contract---a contract which guarantees the BP domain experts that the application-domain focussed understanding of the BPMs they design is also a correct understanding of the code behavior provided by the implementation of the models by software experts. This paves the way for the development of certifiably correct BPMs and their implementations. To illustrate one practical and one conceptual application of the concept we a) instantiate ASM Nets to model the behavioral meaning of the graphical and textual notations used in the commercial S-BPM tool suite with its focus on communication (service interaction) and b) show that applying the rigorous ASM refinement concept to ASM Nets supports IBM's Guard-Stage-Milestone approach to adaptive case management by an accurate conceptual foundation.,,,1,10,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Domain (software engineering); Business process modeling; Implementation; Software; Service (systems architecture); Computer science; Component (UML); IBM,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/2723839.2723840 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2723839.2723840 http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Bpmn/AsmNets.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/s-bpm-one/s-bpm-one2015.html#BorgerF15 https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Bpmn/AsmNets.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2723839.2723840,,10.1145/2723839.2723840,1976005345,,0,005-481-542-380-901; 005-719-893-584-719; 006-178-200-253-237; 013-371-794-927-216; 015-203-426-052-778; 015-705-102-049-054; 016-925-362-718-85X; 022-955-585-690-019; 030-163-063-026-49X; 030-266-627-017-428; 031-883-355-327-261; 033-575-985-011-817; 034-909-791-550-090; 037-839-009-369-768; 040-160-680-572-188; 042-173-965-462-367; 043-160-022-814-818; 049-728-447-157-62X; 050-309-871-652-59X; 051-207-280-802-006; 052-106-375-496-682; 055-600-159-130-793; 059-553-350-068-285; 066-438-289-080-25X; 066-458-503-104-207; 068-653-680-645-983; 072-884-492-292-431; 075-720-252-535-455; 077-628-111-262-511; 080-491-897-850-043; 095-581-760-613-083; 099-193-983-599-312; 100-638-520-723-965; 102-201-064-387-355; 109-226-156-590-33X; 111-076-093-380-650; 113-330-233-645-723; 115-630-405-793-069; 117-821-177-762-731; 123-082-630-503-713; 123-242-253-603-830; 130-708-228-525-901; 137-011-317-915-332; 141-012-865-375-081; 151-873-424-682-606; 152-812-586-213-906; 154-000-910-997-626; 154-550-982-498-232; 178-468-381-979-813; 180-465-279-891-362; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-483-051-287-365,7,false,,

A query is issued during a certain step, but the step ends before any reply is received. Later, a reply arrives, and later yet the algorithm makes use of this reply. By a persistent query, we mean a query for which a late reply might be used. Our proposal involves issuing, along with a persistent query, a location where a late reply is to be stored. After presenting our proposal in general terms, we discuss the modifications that it requires in the existing axiomatics of interactive sequential algorithms and in the existing syntax and semantics of abstract state machines.

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of (self-stabilizing) infrastructure for their execution such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system.

IRS-III is a framework and platform for developing WSMO based semantic web services. Our choreography framework is based on the KADS system-client co-operation model that represents communication through two dimensions: the message direction and which actor has the initiative. Our formalism is state based and is thus compliant with Abstract State Machine (ASM) model used within WSMO. In addition to describing our approach in this paper we provide a formal semantics for IRS Choreography and a full implementation which we illustrate through an example application.,3,,62,62c,Software engineering; Application software; Formalism (philosophy of mathematics); World Wide Web; Abstract state machines; Choreography; Semantic Web; WSMO; Web service; Computer science,,,,,http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/dip/resources/papers/HICSS2006.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2006.454 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hicss/hicss2006-3.html#DomingueGC06 https://www.computer.org/csdl/pds/api/csdl/proceedings/download-article/12OmNC1GujD/pdf http://oro.open.ac.uk/23002/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1579416/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1579416/ https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/hicss/2006/250730062c/12OmNC1GujD,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hicss.2006.454,,10.1109/hicss.2006.454,2010410762,,0,007-173-209-960-302; 011-882-101-302-486; 044-919-390-468-397; 091-258-147-978-476; 100-638-520-723-965; 144-263-222-545-257; 144-855-732-375-12X; 149-475-135-315-281; 154-531-365-131-263; 154-606-989-031-715; 159-685-457-670-241,5,false,,

Mutation testing is time-consuming and computationally expensive by nature. Therefore, automated tool support is indispensable for conducting mutation testing. Little research has been devoted to applying mutation testing to the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism. This paper presents Mu AsmetaL, an As metal-based experimental system for conducting automated mutation analysis. Mu AsmetaL supports the generation of As metal-based mutants (produced by applying a set of 44 mutation operators categorized into 4 classes), executes test cases against the produced mutants, and reports the analysis results. An empirical evaluation of Mu AsmetaL has been conducted using a set of 6 publicly available As metal specifications.",,,421,426,Algorithm; Data mining; Test case; Formalism (philosophy of mathematics); Experimental system; Abstract state machines; Test suite; Mutation testing; Mutation operator; Graphical user interface; Computer science,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7113509/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/itng.2015.74,,10.1109/itng.2015.74,1494576050,,0,000-777-738-898-770; 008-968-436-541-12X; 050-999-068-227-763; 054-501-165-379-149; 072-161-826-702-236; 077-434-382-391-15X; 081-190-127-139-738; 085-278-493-726-942; 100-225-089-765-782; 134-093-538-679-022; 139-330-264-873-706; 189-521-689-083-502,3,false,,

The survey covers the period from 1984, when the idea for the concept of ASMs (under the name dynamic or evolving algebras or structures) appears for the first time in a foundational context, to the year 2001 where a mathematically well-founded, practical system development method based upon the notion of ASMs is in place and ready to be industrially deployed. Some lessons for the future of ASMs are drawn. The ASM method for high-level design and analysis of computing systems natu- rally grew out ofthe foundational concern which led to the discovery ofthe notion of ASMs, although it took some time for the concept to sink in. Indeed as often happens with ideas which change the way we look at things, its ""real""ization —through becoming the basis for an intellectual, machine supported instrument for practical system design and analysis—encountered significant resistance in the scientific community. In this paper we survey the already rich ASM literature and the salient steps ofthe development ofthe ASM method out ofits origins. This reflexion, upon where we came from and upon the way we went, helps to bring into focus some risks and challenges for the future of the ASM approach to industrial system development.

Starting with a hypothesis about negative complexity in the environment of human persons today it describes a strategy, how to assist human persons to reduce this complexity by using a semiotic system. The basic ingredients of this strategy are a visual programming interface with an appropriate abstract state machine, which has to be realized by distributed virtual machines. The distributed virtual machines must be scalable, have to allow parallel processing, have to be fault tolerant, and should have the potential to work in real time. The objects, which have to be processed by these virtual machines, are logical models (LModels), which represent dynamic knowledge, including self learning systems. The descriptions are based on a concrete open source project called Planet Earth Simulator.</jats:p>",,,330,342,Semiotics; Cognitive science; Computational semiotics; Computer science,,,,,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/reducing-negative-complexity-computational-semiotic/28946,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59904-063-9.ch012,,10.4018/978-1-59904-063-9.ch012,2501712022,,0,,1,false,,

The MSL-centric framework allows the definition of the structure of MAPE-K loops using the MAPE Specification Language (MSL), and the description of its adaptation logic in terms of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). These models can be tested by exploiting classical model-based testing for ASMs that allows structural coverage of ASM models, but which is not adequate to test executions that are peculiar of the structure of MAPE-K loops. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a MAPE-based testing approach, which generates, from the MSL model, test goals specifying requirements on the control loop executions, translates these into concrete test predicates for the corresponding self-adaptive ASM, and then generates (by using a model checking based technique) abstract tests covering these test predicates. Such abstract tests are suitable to test the desired executions of MAPE control loops. The application of the approach is demonstrated on a smart home case study.",,,43,51,Model checking; Computer engineering; Abstract state machines; Model-based testing; Control system; Structure (mathematical logic); Specification language; Computer science; Home automation; Adaptation (computer science),,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/182228 https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/800004 https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTW50294.2020.00024 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icst/icstw2020.html#ArcainiMRS20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icstw50294.2020.00024,,10.1109/icstw50294.2020.00024,3047538273,,0,003-961-562-160-009; 006-244-045-917-365; 019-113-402-382-947; 021-003-498-716-896; 033-900-257-525-98X; 038-590-121-398-521; 040-736-326-793-892; 044-566-999-227-381; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-299-736-589-511; 051-460-067-691-756; 056-856-322-909-445; 058-550-246-937-217; 063-510-241-020-340; 068-210-542-579-698; 071-669-167-146-571; 081-303-282-144-017; 085-278-493-726-942; 087-605-738-064-122; 099-943-874-354-121; 131-836-227-316-887; 140-104-197-656-313; 148-286-190-701-960; 167-036-940-702-338; 167-896-065-369-695; 181-401-889-710-788,4,false,,

In this paper we present an approach for the conceptual modelling of such systems, which is grounded in a distributed middleware that coordinates the client access to multiple clouds through a concept of mediator. Furthermore, each component of the middleware constitutes an abstract machine that is realised by three layers: a layer for normal operation, a layer for monitoring and detection of critical situations, and an adaptation layer, which in case of an identified anomaly changes the normal behaviour. The semantics of this autonomous system can be captured by linguistic reflection, for which reflective Abstract State Machines will be exploited.",,,120,133,Distributed computing; Middleware; Abstract state machines; Software system; Artificial intelligence; Conceptual model (computer science); Natural language processing; Computer science; Cloud computing; System of systems; Adaptation (computer science); Autonomous system (mathematics),,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_10 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_10 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/er/er2017.html#BugaNS17 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/er/er2017.html#BugaNS17 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-69904-2_10 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-69904-2_10.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_10,,10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_10,2765625746,,0,002-303-791-871-874; 011-453-611-566-136; 018-977-862-842-395; 025-447-165-223-578; 030-066-676-265-106; 033-092-785-757-554; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-172-473-573-484; 035-499-478-561-807; 040-160-680-572-188; 046-838-597-306-588; 050-309-871-652-59X; 053-467-150-591-945; 054-216-294-570-932; 058-974-031-275-841; 062-292-596-479-08X; 064-739-024-773-030; 069-916-418-196-455; 089-177-439-212-556; 095-966-251-130-718; 101-704-045-813-337; 105-768-234-371-847; 123-051-049-692-715; 130-471-786-820-195; 139-330-264-873-706; 173-897-524-432-182; 176-491-295-048-855; 181-401-889-710-788,5,false,,

Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable ""semantic units"" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework.

Custom algorithms to verify these properties automatically have been devised for a number of specification languages, including SCR, RSML, and Statecharts. In this paper, we provide means to automatically verify completeness and consistency of Abstract State Machine (ASM) specifications. The verification is performed using a widely available tool, a SAT solver. The use of a SAT solver removes the need for designing and fine tuning language specific verification algorithms. Furthermore, the use of a SAT solver automates the verification procedure and produces a counterexample automatically when a specification is incomplete or inconsistent. We provide an algorithm to translate ASM specifications to a SAT problem instance. The translation is illustrated using the TASM toolset in conjunction with the “production cell system” case study.",190,2,85,97,Consistency (database systems); Abstract state machines; Translation (geometry); Counterexample; Completeness (order theory); Programming language; Computer science; Requirements engineering; Boolean satisfiability problem,Verification; Completeness; Consistency; SAT; Abstract State Machines,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82355825 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/entcs/entcs190.html#OuimetL07 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066107005439 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:237149 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82355825.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2007.08.008,,10.1016/j.entcs.2007.08.008,2058933441,,0,019-911-894-187-65X; 020-579-587-866-103; 020-982-366-508-038; 021-003-498-716-896; 025-241-063-530-442; 029-858-763-538-985; 038-467-272-421-692; 043-254-184-800-221; 050-309-871-652-59X; 050-578-715-624-648; 060-046-569-964-120; 069-561-131-419-172; 092-498-931-461-517; 103-368-289-654-347; 121-190-479-708-008; 132-827-557-546-337; 158-101-134-228-442; 161-466-829-532-053; 167-265-902-026-323,18,true,,gold

ASM is a specification method for software and hardware providing a powerful means of modeling various kinds of systems. MDGs are decision diagrams based on abstract representation of data and are used primarily for modeling hardware systems. The notions of ASM and MDG are hence closely related to each other, making it appealing to link these two concepts. The proposed interface between ASM and MDG uses two steps: first, the ASM model is transformed into a flat, simple transition system as an intermediate model. Second, this intermediate model is transformed into the syntax of the input language of the MDG tool, MDG-HDL. We have successfully applied this transformation scheme on a case study, the Island Tunnel Controller, where we automatically generated the corresponding MDG-HDL models from ASM specifications.",2589,,278,292,Model checking; Formal verification; Abstract state machines; High-level programming language; Programming language; Interface (Java); Software; Transition system; Computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_16 http://core.ac.uk/display/15025085 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:98602 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_16 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#GawanmehTW03 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_16.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_16,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_16,1578760196,,0,002-621-690-811-948; 006-558-580-892-106; 010-392-341-004-05X; 014-695-758-839-777; 019-827-300-450-229; 020-013-882-140-265; 020-212-786-497-100; 025-992-795-669-13X; 032-703-995-573-28X; 039-980-452-061-771; 044-748-027-808-63X; 064-404-416-242-525; 067-114-472-780-831; 071-133-902-038-433; 080-776-799-398-806; 085-647-232-787-131; 105-374-125-615-695; 107-137-949-458-147,11,false,,

Following the approach of Blass and Gurevich to parallel algorithms, we then formulate general postulates for quantum algorithms and show that every algorithm satisfying these postulates is simulated by an appropriate ASM.

Fruja; Robert F. Stärk,"Turbo Abstract State Machines are ASMs with parallel and sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. Turbo ASMs are viewed as black-boxes that can combine arbitrary many steps of one or more submachines into one big step. The intermediate steps of a turbo ASM are not observable from outside. It is not even clear what exactly the intermediate steps are, because the semantics of turbo ASMs is usually defined inductively along the call graph of the ASM and the structure of the rule bodies. The most important application of turbo ASMs are recursive algorithms. Such algorithms can directly be simulated on turbo ASMs without transforming them into multi-agent (distributed) ASMs. In this article we analyze the hidden intermediate steps of turbo ASMs and characterize them using PAR/SEQ trees. We also address the problem of the reserve in the presence of recursion and sequential composition. Turbo ASMs with return values are obtained by syntactic sugar.",,,244,262,Recursion; Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Partial evaluation; Turbo; Computer science; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_14 http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:4595/eth-4595-01.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_14 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#FrujaS03 https://core.ac.uk/display/24455242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_14,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_14,1585799109,,0,002-438-766-985-114; 004-266-873-563-413; 004-410-486-404-600; 028-123-482-947-439; 034-400-132-510-675; 041-863-663-936-741; 059-553-350-068-285; 069-050-537-784-263; 070-964-565-422-59X; 073-111-177-402-911; 084-663-601-596-132; 089-669-400-006-844; 092-195-924-604-606; 105-620-622-527-144; 195-635-564-405-355,11,true,,green

A Gurevich abstract state machine was given in evidence that Ibn Sīnā really did intend an algorithm; this was needed because Ibn Sīnā explained the algorithm by a long sequence of exercises, not by a rigorous definition. More recently a radically original logical decision algorithm has come to light in the work of the 12th century Baghdad scholar Abū al-Barakāt. Taking these algorithms alongside the already known algorithms of al-Khwārizmī for solving quadratic equations, and of al-Khalīl for listing finite sequences of letters, we can see that the medieval Arabic scholars uncovered a range of algorithms of various kinds. But it seems that they never brought these algorithms together under a single notion of ‘algorithm’; in fact we know of no writer who drew a comparison between any two of these algorithms. A natural question for historical research is to uncover what kinds of entity the medieval Arabic scholars thought these algorithms were. The present paper assembles some raw material that should be relevant to this question, including a not very successful attempt by al-Fārābī to institute a theory of logical procedures.",,,133,146,Algorithm; Quadratic equation; Philosophy; Comparative historical research; Abstract state machines; Range (mathematics); Listing (computer); Sequence; Natural (music); Arabic,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/gurevich2020.html#Hodges20 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48006-6_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48006-6_10,,10.1007/978-3-030-48006-6_10,3027919790,,0,000-614-099-112-754; 001-651-674-960-40X; 021-988-213-356-540; 044-593-823-508-108; 050-007-970-839-604; 051-989-823-265-358; 140-444-247-739-354; 178-945-252-182-102,2,false,,

In fact, they are based on similar combinations of the same mathematical concepts: they both combine declarative concepts of first-order logic with the operational view of transition systems; moreover, they are closely related with respect to the underlying notions of concurrency and non-determinism. On the other hand, the resulting system representations differ considerably (e.g., they use distinct notations and are based on complementary system views) so that it is not immediately clear how they can be combined or transformed into each other. The work presented here investigates the formal relation between ASMs and Pr/T-nets with the aim to integrate them into a common framework for modelling concurrent and embedded systems, where Pr/T-nets are considered as a graphical interface for distributed ASMs. For the class of strict Pr/T-nets (which constitutes the basic form of Pr/T-nets) a transformation to distributed ASMs will be given.",,,108,122,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Embedded system; Concurrency; Operational View; Programming language; Relation (database); Petri net; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine; Systems theory,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0025038 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0025038 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/eurocast/eurocast1997.html#Glasser97,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bfb0025038,,10.1007/bfb0025038,1839786476,,0,006-555-745-475-703; 009-708-183-516-959; 020-579-587-866-103; 037-765-632-256-264; 058-576-239-793-986; 060-348-667-460-78X; 065-074-981-051-374; 066-926-974-262-484; 076-073-572-022-016; 086-009-723-389-883; 092-672-228-462-535; 108-418-380-065-492; 109-364-382-047-373; 129-254-348-816-456; 156-100-028-127-181; 166-534-678-548-536,1,false,,

Ejnioui; Carlos E. Otero; Abrar A. Qureshi,"Recently, sequence diagrams have been extended with the introduction of a set of operators in the latest specification of the Unified Modeling Language 2 (UML 2). Embedded in combined fragments, these operators are intended to simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of its events. However, the latest specification introduces a non-trivial degree of ambiguity in the interpretation and understanding of sequence diagrams. As these diagrams are increasingly adopted as modeling tools in embedded software, their ambiguity can exacerbate the challenges encountered in embedded system design. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of the loop, break and strict operators in sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and their related constraints.",,,106,111,Formal verification; Unified Modeling Language; Formal semantics (linguistics); Sequence diagram; Embedded software; Operational semantics; Story-driven modeling; Programming language; Computer science; Formal methods; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6735057/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icos.2013.6735057,,10.1109/icos.2013.6735057,2043510123,,0,105-620-622-527-144; 139-330-264-873-706; 159-976-005-385-976,2,false,,

Studies have revealed that most of the anomalies, discovered in the development of complex systems, belong to requirement and specification phases. To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. Model-based techniques, enabling formal semantics and requirements traceability, are emerging as promising solutions to cost-effective requirements validation. In these techniques, the functional behaviors derived from lower-level requirements are specified in terms of analyzable models at a certain level of abstraction. Further, upper-level requirements are formalized into verifiable queries and/or formulas. Meanwhile, trace links between requirements at various levels of abstraction as well as between requirements and subsequent artifacts (such as verifiable queries and/or formulas, and analyzable models) are built, through which the queries and/or formulas can be fed into the corresponding models. However, such model-based techniques suffer from some limitations, such as how to support semi- or fully-automatic trace links creation between diverse development artifacts, how to ease the demand of heavy mathematics background knowledge to specify queries and/or formulas, and how to analyze models without encountering the state explosion problem. In this thesis, we cover two aspects centering around requirements validation to ease the aforementioned limitations, which are mainly about requirements traceability and model-based requirements validation. In particular, the technical contributions are four-fold: 1) we have introduced an improved VSM-based requirements traceability creation/recovery approach using a novel context analysis and, 2) we have proposed a lightweight model-based approach to requirements validation by using the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined Observer and Event constructs and, 3) we have combined our model-based approach with a restricted use case modeling approach for feature-oriented requirements validation and, 4) we have improved the Observer construct of TASM via proposing a new observer specification logic to facilitate the observer specification, as well as defining the corresponding observer execution process. Finally, we have demonstrated the applicability of our contributions in real world usage through various applications.",,,47,54,Software requirements specification; Requirement; Abstract state machines; Non-functional requirement; Requirements traceability; Computer science; Functional specification; Requirements analysis; Real-time computing; System requirements specification,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:743953 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6908679/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/re/ret2014.html#ZhouLL14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ret.2014.6908679,,10.1109/ret.2014.6908679,2084463489,,0,003-196-924-988-132; 008-441-193-644-376; 020-811-909-348-733; 021-518-769-824-032; 028-528-311-609-537; 038-807-967-076-942; 059-825-679-645-486; 077-769-970-681-940; 102-496-851-720-517; 139-330-264-873-706; 139-573-023-308-243; 140-673-515-288-57X; 152-550-321-924-14X; 173-897-524-432-182,4,true,,green

The problem motivated a quest of stronger and stronger PTime logics. All these logics avoid arbitrary choice. Here we attempt to capture the choiceless fragment of PTime.

Models that compute these functions are called Turing-complete. For example, we know that common imperative languages (such as C, Ada or P ython) are Turing complete (up to unbounded memory). Algorithmic completeness is a stronger notion than Turing-completeness. It focuses not only on the input-output behavior of the computation but more importantly on the step-by-step behavior. Moreover, the issue is not limited to partial recursive functions, it applies to any set of functions. A model could compute all the desired functions, but some algorithms (ways to compute these functions) could be missing (see [10, 27] for examples related to primitive recursive algorithms). This paper's purpose is to prove that common imperative languages are not only Turing-complete but also algorithmically complete, by using the axiomatic definition of the Gurevich's Thesis and a fair bisimulation between the Abstract State Machines of Gurevich (defined in [16]) and a version of Jones' While programs.

The attack scenarios or security requirements in some of these IDSs are specified in attack specification languages which are separate from software specification languages. The use of two different languages for software specification and attack specification may generate redundant and conflicting requirements. The advantage of using the same language for both functional specifications and attacks specifications is that software designers can address the two different issues without learning the two types of languages. We present a method of using a software specification language called Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) as an attack specification language for the open source IDS Snort. This work provides AsmL users an IDS that they can use without knowing how to write Snort rules. We automatically translate attack scenarios written in AsmL into Snort rules with context information. The original Snort is modified so that it can use the rules automatically generated by the translator. Adding context information to Snort rules improves the detection capability of Snort. To show the efficacy of our presented approach, we have built a prototype and evaluated it using a number of well-known attack scenarios.",,,31,8,Software requirements specification; Abstract state machines; Attack; Programming language; Specification language; Software; Intrusion detection system; Computer science; Functional specification; Software security assurance,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/1501434.1501472 http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1501434.1501472 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1501434.1501472 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pst/pst2006.html#GravesZ06,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1501434.1501472,,10.1145/1501434.1501472,1990460504,,0,010-879-691-706-072; 033-820-436-580-458; 042-139-236-688-500; 049-484-005-083-012; 062-754-408-944-997; 069-134-219-719-640; 113-585-275-150-192; 118-811-919-346-268; 128-142-405-176-908; 141-645-980-266-729; 148-232-227-837-375; 176-576-241-751-425; 194-589-331-287-190,9,false,,

The server model is focussed on the Request-Reply pattern, and specifies a delegation strategy where the handling of a request is entrusted to a module. We show how several major frameworks for web applications can be described as progressive refinements of a number of basic modules. Three modules are further detailed: static file transfer, CGI and generic scripting modules. We provide ASM models of a script-capable web browser and a modules-based web server.Particular care is devoted to those aspects that allow executing modern web applications.These models have explanatory value in themselves, and could be used for a more formal validation.In addition, we show how a continuation-passing semantics can be used to good effect in ASM models.",94,,69,92,Web server; Web API; Web modeling; Web-based simulation; Static web page; Client-side scripting; Programming language; Web page; Computer science; Web navigation,Web applications; Abstract State Machines; JavaScript,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/80256918 http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/SwEngg/WebApplInfrastructureSCP14.pdf https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000926 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp94.html#GervasiBC14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167642314000926 https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/SwEngg/WebApplInfrastructureSCP14.pdf https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80256918.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025,,10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025,2085797030,,0,021-878-070-887-207; 022-955-585-690-019; 024-563-953-605-747; 025-000-672-252-436; 026-929-059-967-491; 030-694-560-871-857; 033-348-523-609-013; 034-909-791-550-090; 036-602-408-908-78X; 040-216-749-039-446; 043-089-235-712-971; 059-553-350-068-285; 060-776-050-843-781; 062-160-210-772-466; 063-056-611-041-388; 065-383-421-518-123; 065-891-220-000-986; 072-884-492-292-431; 077-315-391-882-67X; 096-754-613-880-295; 098-685-870-265-425; 101-704-045-813-337; 123-082-630-503-713; 137-011-317-915-332; 154-896-114-434-819; 178-607-662-063-948; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-635-564-405-355,2,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,green

We formalise this problem by the notion of the greatest consistent specialisation (GCS) adapting and generalising this 20 year old concept to sequential Abstract State Machines (ASMs) with emphasis on bounded parallelism. In a state satisfying I such that P is repairable the notion of consistent specialisation will require an enlargement of the update set, which defines a partial order with respect to which a GCS is defined. We show that GCSs are compositional in two respects: (1) the GCS of an ASM with a complex rule can be obtained from the GCSs of the involved assignments, and (2) the GCS with respect to a set of invariants can be built using the GCSs for the individual invariants in the set.",,,219,235,Discrete mathematics; Principle of compositionality; Abstract state machines; Enforcement; Program specification; First order; Bounded function; Computer science; Invariant (mathematics); Successor cardinal,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32409-4_14 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icfem/icfem2019.html#Schewe19 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,,10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,2982526712,,0,003-747-112-190-035; 015-574-147-878-609; 021-750-860-201-879; 031-058-645-527-712; 034-400-132-510-675; 040-440-509-441-854; 042-151-895-979-653; 050-309-871-652-59X; 058-974-031-275-841; 066-006-964-963-613; 085-098-810-136-199; 089-353-438-562-001; 108-925-457-506-038; 127-988-145-609-81X; 139-330-264-873-706; 150-827-661-654-162; 153-474-475-731-687; 160-530-367-454-325; 186-076-165-513-653,0,false,,

The theory comprises a set of language-independent postulates characterising the class of RSAs, an abstract machine model that provably satisfies the postulates, and a proof that all RSAs are captured by this machine model. As in Gurevich’s thesis for sequential algorithms RSAs are sequential-time, bounded parallel algorithms, where the bound depends on the algorithm only and not on the input. Different from the class of sequential algorithms every state of an RSA includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection.

The composition of multiple parties' business processes is always done with a specific objective in mind. Not only in the positive case, but also if the objective of a business process can not be fulfilled, all participating business processes need to be in some expected recovery state. We propose a composition algorithm solving the task of designing a collaborative business process while respecting a set of primary and recovery goals. In our model, each business process is described as a finite state machine. The multiplication of all business processes in one single model of possible executions would lead to an explosion of the number of states. Therefore, our composition algorithm directly interprets the multiple finite state machine (FSM) representations and creates a collaborative business process without integrating all FSMs into a single FSM upfront. Our composition algorithm returns an orchestration of the given business processes only in the case that it can be assured that each execution only leads to an expected primary or recovery goal. In order to prove our concepts, we first mathematically define the execution of business processes and orchestrations by providing abstract state machine (ASM) representations for them. Second, we execute the ASMs in the execution engine CoreASM which shows that the generated orchestration steers the execution of the business processes as intended.",,,262,269,Business rule; Software engineering; Artifact-centric business process model; Business Process Model and Notation; Business domain; Programming language; Business process modeling; Computer science; Business Process Execution Language; Business process management; Business process discovery,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4278806/ https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/services/2007/29260262/12OmNzdoN0s http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004278806 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/IEEEscc/scw2007.html#LemckeF07 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4278806/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/services.2007.24,,10.1109/services.2007.24,2095544716,,0,050-309-871-652-59X; 053-082-645-846-05X; 060-776-050-843-781; 139-330-264-873-706; 153-335-556-174-472; 189-521-689-083-502,16,true,,green

We outline the Abstract State Machines (ASM) method, a discipline for reliable system development which allows one to bridge the gap between informal requirements and executable code by combining application-centric experimentally validatable system modelling with mathematically verifiable stepwise detailing of abstract models to compile-time-verifiable code.",19,2,225,241,Abstract state machines; Executable; Code (cryptography); Compiler; Programming language; Theory of computation; Software; Computer science; Verifiable secret sharing; Abstract machine,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00165-006-0019-y https://arpi.unipi.it/handle/11568/112681?mode=full.1 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-006-0019-y https://doi.org/10.1007/s00165-006-0019-y https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-006-0019-y http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Methodology/VstteFacJ06.pdf https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Methodology/VstteFacJ06.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00165-006-0019-y https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fac/fac19.html#Borger07 https://core.ac.uk/display/54906777,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-006-0019-y,,10.1007/s00165-006-0019-y,2068831082,,0,002-272-342-948-443; 005-824-317-730-874; 005-919-900-156-170; 008-638-531-729-145; 009-708-183-516-959; 010-999-872-320-79X; 013-790-960-098-756; 014-386-867-562-19X; 016-925-362-718-85X; 020-013-882-140-265; 020-579-587-866-103; 022-955-585-690-019; 027-765-297-864-912; 028-123-482-947-439; 028-252-143-067-876; 028-647-212-633-541; 030-266-627-017-428; 030-281-777-212-70X; 032-043-613-838-377; 032-050-565-946-191; 032-102-695-785-500; 032-354-281-297-321; 035-483-021-070-489; 037-162-609-586-895; 038-070-583-690-35X; 039-496-365-985-998; 040-108-310-040-813; 041-863-663-936-741; 044-748-027-808-63X; 047-351-177-661-42X; 048-186-921-823-408; 049-728-447-157-62X; 050-309-871-652-59X; 051-913-157-012-007; 053-202-034-014-469; 054-498-016-878-652; 055-572-533-018-262; 060-046-569-964-120; 060-733-812-776-088; 061-894-295-420-641; 063-229-748-620-48X; 064-693-127-071-671; 066-458-503-104-207; 069-003-369-155-473; 069-808-530-276-342; 070-224-959-381-109; 071-545-089-013-049; 078-154-283-914-947; 080-150-543-870-121; 080-226-308-995-766; 080-491-897-850-043; 083-187-716-670-274; 084-780-125-638-524; 086-580-077-926-535; 087-186-960-950-682; 093-188-772-751-578; 094-046-015-838-433; 095-581-760-613-083; 095-703-372-981-063; 096-097-430-136-538; 100-011-765-145-332; 100-638-520-723-965; 105-454-480-607-067; 105-506-248-732-017; 106-453-604-888-430; 110-526-058-726-993; 113-330-233-645-723; 115-379-340-834-570; 117-821-177-762-731; 118-475-930-003-733; 120-291-184-699-833; 120-585-158-589-503; 124-614-374-692-64X; 126-341-092-906-584; 126-360-827-553-593; 130-708-228-525-901; 130-798-461-674-42X; 136-022-573-633-980; 136-041-173-907-077; 137-011-317-915-332; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-920-708-764-819; 154-000-910-997-626; 161-215-557-312-826; 166-372-154-991-140; 167-078-666-488-425; 168-124-772-764-447; 171-904-473-379-026; 176-197-240-615-472; 178-468-381-979-813; 183-394-089-255-799; 184-044-966-704-362; 189-521-689-083-502; 189-603-730-428-63X; 195-635-564-405-355,35,true,,green

Alobaidi; Andriy Batyiv; Grygoriy Zholtkevych,"The main goal of this paper is to give a rigorous mathematical description of systems for processing quantum information. To do it authors consider abstract state machines as models of classical computational systems. This class of machines is refined by introducing constrains on a state structure, namely, it is assumed that state of computational process has two components: a control unit state and a memory state. Then authors modify the class of models by substituting the deterministic evolutionary mechanism for a stochastic evolutionary mechanism. This approach can be generalized to the quantum case: one can replace transformations of a classical memory with quantum operations on a quantum memory. Hence the authors come to the need to construct a mathematical model of an operation on the quantum memory. It leads them to the notion of an abstract quantum automaton. Further the authors demonstrate that a quantum teleportation process is described as evolutionary process for some abstract quantum automaton.",,,17,32,Automaton; Class (set theory); Abstract state machines; Quantum information; Computer science; State (computer science); Theoretical computer science; Quantum; Quantum teleportation; Process (computing),,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3986 http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-848/ICTERI-2012-CEUR-WS-paper-36-p-17-32.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1204.html#abs-1204-3986,https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3986,,,2963757788,,0,000-745-232-131-816; 014-159-852-652-23X; 031-091-098-464-621; 031-909-553-637-650; 034-400-132-510-675; 045-145-733-082-155; 062-001-574-519-586; 068-123-062-164-64X; 070-800-253-737-727; 103-432-912-443-001; 105-620-622-527-144; 110-957-509-286-304; 113-348-129-538-245; 177-196-707-059-409,0,true,,unknown

This paper presents a novel approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the Abstract State Machine as runtime model representing the enforcement strategy aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. The enforcer software is designed as an autonomic manager that wraps around the software system to monitor and manage unsafe system changes using probing and effecting interfaces provided by the system, so realising grey-box safety enforcement.

Time is continuous what is motivated by specifications of hybrid systems. Our goal is to try to find a framework that is based on applied first order logic that permits to represent the verification problem directly, completely and conservatively (as explained in Introduction), and that is apt to describe interesting decidable classes, maybe showing way to feasible algorithms. To achieve this goal we use a first order timed logic that is an extension of a decidable theory of reals with timed functions. This logic permits, on the one hand, to rewrite directly and completely requirements and, on the other hand, to describe executions of various timed algorithms—here we consider block Gurevich abstract state machines because of their theoretical clarity and sufficient expressive power. Then we describe one decidable class of the verification problem that is based on notions reflecting finiteness properties of systems of control. These notions may be of independent interest, as, in particular, they give a way to describe a limited usage of arithmetics preserving decidability that is not covered by existing model-theoretic approaches. As an example we consider the generalized railroad crossing problem that we analyze in its entirety.",113,1-3,13,52,First-order logic; Algorithm; Class (set theory); Abstract state machines; Decidability; Control (linguistics); Extension (predicate logic); Block (programming); Mathematics; Hybrid system; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007201000495 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168007201000495#! https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/apal/apal113.html#BeauquierS01 https://philpapers.org/rec/BEAAFO,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0168-0072(01)00049-5,,10.1016/s0168-0072(01)00049-5,2051073429,,0,006-555-745-475-703; 019-043-895-820-341; 022-596-400-136-627; 025-514-448-365-880; 028-395-176-951-113; 029-716-640-124-260; 030-669-272-879-366; 035-472-280-060-118; 052-662-994-155-999; 053-192-882-321-57X; 062-098-593-840-926; 063-340-995-862-940; 067-042-828-672-760; 080-776-799-398-806; 092-025-969-972-128; 101-123-184-766-168; 111-076-093-380-650; 117-105-514-004-353; 129-224-329-779-197; 130-706-852-594-231; 135-183-707-405-758; 157-311-554-599-521; 171-732-388-748-757; 173-021-302-833-734; 180-731-499-233-432; 181-128-917-936-30X,25,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. The process has been used to validate our model-to-code transformations.",32,2,1,25,Model checking; Transformation (function); Code generation; Abstract state machines; Unit testing; Code (cryptography); Programming language; Computer science; Correctness; Process (computing),,,,"Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie",https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/150836 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/smr/smr32.html#BonfantiGM20 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smr.2205 https://aisberg.unibg.it/bitstream/10446/150836/1/asm2Cpp_JSEP.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smr.2205,,10.1002/smr.2205,2991630525,,0,009-544-165-808-28X; 016-999-594-439-798; 022-452-454-933-784; 023-419-894-483-870; 027-659-430-073-484; 028-788-300-731-677; 037-766-818-077-138; 046-838-597-306-588; 048-354-160-486-020; 049-065-427-221-538; 051-827-235-040-943; 064-742-446-621-130; 067-273-361-710-345; 074-234-468-327-145; 076-556-632-340-910; 085-278-493-726-942; 094-497-106-858-918; 096-640-174-420-83X; 097-563-252-167-789; 100-011-765-145-332; 122-512-813-599-624; 128-703-882-923-280; 131-831-837-346-634; 139-330-264-873-706; 140-294-050-741-177; 149-343-916-985-945; 178-809-484-342-236; 194-699-395-880-724,24,true,,green

The different ways in which a system can operate are associated with different modes, and transitions link modes to form mode-machines. However, mode-machines need a precise semantics if they are to be used for specifying the behaviour of critical systems. This paper analyses the possible relationships between modes and states. A number of concurrent systems described using MASCOT are considered, and their mode-based behaviour is used to motivate the semantics of a new real-time mode-machine notation, RTMMs. It is argued that RTMMs should not behave like abstract state-machines. A list of concurrent transactions is associated with each RTMM mode, and a notation is given for specifying their timing properties. RTMM transactions need not terminate when the central mode-controller switches mode, thus capturing the asynchronous way in which large systems respond to mode changes. RTMMs are given a proof-theoretic semantics using many-sorted logic, extended with the RTL occurrence relation, Θ.",,,90,109,Mode (statistics); Control engineering; Asynchronous communication; Semantics (computer science); Relation (database); Structuring; Computer science; Notation; Complex system; Concurrent engineering; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61648-9_36 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61648-9_36 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ftrtft/ftrtft1996.html#Paynter96,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-61648-9_36,,10.1007/3-540-61648-9_36,1520056812,,0,005-858-147-875-039; 018-730-454-098-195; 029-070-776-055-559; 043-144-139-685-028; 047-305-624-402-300; 054-846-496-589-187; 074-651-254-892-293; 076-783-085-604-867; 080-510-447-873-302; 086-934-682-405-995; 106-911-132-232-067; 113-636-789-616-700; 114-723-268-888-518; 126-722-016-583-006; 131-685-911-636-064; 153-631-010-647-65X; 154-849-942-684-117; 171-279-511-292-263; 176-822-190-482-747; 181-411-989-710-354; 196-982-420-803-891,14,false,,

Starting from system models, users are able to automatically generate machine code in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Asm2C++ [4] is the tool that transforms Abstract State Machine models to Open image in new window code. However, no validation activities have been performed in the past to guarantee the correctness of the transformation process. In this paper, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests.

However, there are still challenges hindering the wide-scale industrial application of model-based design. One of these unsolved problems is the lack of a practical, effective method for the formal specification of DSML semantics. This problem has negative impact on reusability of DSML-s and analysis tools in domain specific tool chains. To address these issues, we propose a formal well founded methodology with supporting tools to anchor the semantics of DSML-s to precisely defined and validated ""semantic units"". In our methodology, each of the syntactic and semantic DSML components is defined precisely and completely. The main contribution of our approach is that it moves toward an infrastructure for DSML design that integrates formal methods with practical engineering tools.

Such partial updates need to be efficiently checked for consistency and integrated. This is the problem of partial updates in a nutshell. In our first paper on the subject we proposed a general solution of the partial-update problem for abstract state machines (ASMs) where the problem is exacerbated by the use of nested submachines; in particular we solved the problem in the cases of counters, sets and maps. Here we propose a more general framework that allows us to solve the problem for sequences and labeled ordered trees. The partial update problem for sequences is related to the problem of collaborative editing.",2589,,57,86,Algorithm; Consistency (database systems); Abstract state machines; Set (abstract data type); Query language; Specification language; Collaborative editing; Sequence; Computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_4 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_4 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/156-partial-updates-exploration/ https://core.ac.uk/display/20856124 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#GurevichT03 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/opera/156.pdf https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/156.pdf https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=81202 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_4.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_4,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_4,1573630376,,1,002-438-766-985-114; 046-216-399-297-450; 079-723-355-085-863; 092-195-924-604-606,9,false,,

As updates are fundamentally distinct from queries in many respects, computation models for queries cannot be simply extended to database transformations. This motivates the question whether Abstract State Machines (ASMs) can be used to characterise database transformations in general. In this paper we start examining the differences between database transformations and algorithms, which give rise to the formalisation of five postulates for database transformations. Then a variant of ASMs called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs) is developed, and we prove that DBASMs capture database transformations, i.e. the main result of the paper is that every database transformation stipulated by the postulates can be behaviourally simulated by a DB-ASM.",19,4,765,805,Database theory; Abstract state machines; Database design; Graph database; Programming language; Database transformation; Database schema; Computer science; Computation; View; Database; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/66861 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/66861 https://cyber.bibl.u-szeged.hu/index.php/actcybern/article/view/3796 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/actaC/actaC19.html#ScheweW10,https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/66861,,,138050006,,0,001-996-277-886-545; 005-814-571-688-772; 015-421-225-402-052; 025-007-640-878-196; 026-830-714-409-083; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-172-473-573-484; 035-841-919-756-679; 036-857-749-109-593; 044-328-373-269-72X; 050-995-433-771-903; 061-225-206-697-14X; 082-391-519-387-578; 090-792-735-730-657; 092-195-924-604-606; 100-683-174-205-26X; 124-984-484-040-077; 132-339-412-442-251; 168-196-175-947-627; 189-521-689-083-502,29,false,,

Paiva; Nikolai Tillmann; João Pascoal Faria; Raul Moreira Vidal,"This paper presents a new approach to model and test hierarchical Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). We exploit the structure of Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs) to reduce the number of states in the ”flat” Finite State Machine (FSM) resulting from the exploration of the model. Firstly, independent dialogs are identified and highlighted in a HFSM built from the FSM. Then, the portion of the FSM that describes each dialog is reduced. To illustrate the approach, we construct a model of the Notepad application, which is part of Microsoft Windows. The model is written in Spec] and is converted automatically to a FSM using the Spec Explorer tool developed at Microsoft Research. The HFSM is then defined and the total number of states of the FSM is reduced. Spec Explorer generates test cases from the FSM, and also tests the conformity between the specification and the implementation.",,,329,344,Engineering; Test case; Finite-state machine; Dialog box; Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Engineering drawing; Spec#; Construct (python library); Graphical user interface; Microsoft Windows,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#PaivaTFV05 https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~jpf/research/ASM05.pdf https://web.fe.up.pt/~jpf/research/ASM05.pdf https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/95648 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raul_Vidal2/publication/37650636_Modeling_and_Testing_Hierarchical_GUIs/links/00b49517f9e867d2c3000000.pdf http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#PaivaTFV05,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#PaivaTFV05,,,1545078856,,0,004-165-410-572-804; 014-611-582-735-809; 028-448-364-580-352; 047-031-490-420-021; 050-578-715-624-648; 052-766-080-234-187; 063-871-329-757-009; 105-620-622-527-144; 106-750-278-899-505; 146-579-344-003-185; 155-304-026-125-99X; 165-584-583-684-26X,45,false,,

In order to improve the performance of the generated machine instructions, JIT compilers heavily rely on dynamic analysis of the code. Existing work treats the components of a JIT compiler as a monolithic whole, tied to particular execution semantics. We propose a formal framework that facilitates the design and implementation of a tracing JIT compiler and its accompanying dynamic analyses by decoupling the tracing, optimization, and interpretation processes. This results in a framework that is more configurable and extensible than existing formal tracing models. We formalize the tracer and interpreter as two abstract state machines that communicate through a minimal, well-defined interface. Developing a tracing JIT compiler becomes possible for arbitrary interpreters that implement this interface. The abstract machines also provide the necessary hooks to plug in custom analyses and optimizations.",,,25,30,JIT spraying; Tracing; Abstract state machines; Operational semantics; Compiler; Programming language; Computer science; Tracing just-in-time compilation; Just-in-time compilation; Abstract machine,D.3.1 [Formal Definitions and Theory]: semantics; D.3.4 [Processors]: compilers; optimization Keywords tracing JIT compilation; operational semantics; dynamic analysis,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Papers/Marr/woda15-vandercammen-et-al-a-formal-foundation-for-trace-based-jit-compilers.pdf https://researchportal.vub.be/en/publications/a-formal-foundation-for-trace-based-jit-compilers https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/oopsla/woda2015.html#VandercammenNMK15 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2823363.2823369 http://soft.vub.ac.be/Publications/2015/vub-soft-tr-15-10.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2823363.2823369,,10.1145/2823363.2823369,2016034360,,0,012-569-669-276-458; 018-840-909-415-829; 034-916-983-151-786; 047-956-131-252-059; 065-794-930-119-565; 070-892-972-468-237; 129-617-859-161-770,2,true,,green

Through modern technologies these coalitions may form across company, organization and system borders. Therefor questions of access control and security are of vital significance for the architectures supporting these coalitions. ; In this paper, we present our first steps to reach a formal framework for modeling and verifying the design of privacy-sensitive dynamic coalition infrastructures and their processes. In order to do so we extend existing dynamic coalition modeling approaches with an access-control-concept, which manages access to information through policies. Furthermore we regard the processes underlying these coalitions and present first works in formalizing these processes. As a result of the present paper we illustrate the usefulness of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method for this task. We demonstrate a formal treatment of privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions by two example ASMs which model certain access control situations. A logical consideration of these ASMs can lead to a better understanding and a verification of the ASMs according to the aspired specification.",83,,10,21,Risk analysis (engineering); Autonomous agent; Abstract state machines; Order (exchange); Task (project management); Access to information; Computer science; Access control; Management science,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1204.6090B/abstract http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6090,http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/eptcs.83.2,,10.4204/eptcs.83.2,3149634475; 2005036008,,0,002-486-386-863-883; 005-052-264-607-233; 013-000-822-065-13X; 041-778-957-852-520; 042-063-677-256-393; 043-406-126-008-703; 052-254-745-101-698; 054-436-479-999-801; 055-906-099-289-63X; 064-721-272-090-460; 095-382-838-815-581; 139-330-264-873-706; 166-828-573-430-56X; 196-464-841-214-921,1,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

The user then specifies each component of the system architecture using UML inspired state machines, and refines/transforms these (abstract) state machines into concrete state machines. It is shown that if the abstract specification adheres to the security requirements, then so does the concrete one provided that certain conditions are satisfied.</jats:p>",,,199,229,Computer science; Unified Modeling Language; Information flow; Component (thermodynamics); Computer security model; State (computer science); Software engineering; Information security; Set (abstract data type); Software; Programming language; Computer security; Philosophy; Linguistics; Physics; Thermodynamics,,,,,https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/11250/2389194/3/SINTEF%2bA11357.pdf https://hdl.handle.net/11250/2389194,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-60960-747-0.ch010,,10.4018/978-1-60960-747-0.ch010,,,0,006-922-180-101-393; 008-594-175-926-609; 010-579-888-922-954; 020-947-822-437-998; 022-819-291-970-545; 023-642-777-312-433; 025-549-384-879-179; 030-869-245-783-410; 033-665-262-186-428; 043-196-986-574-833; 047-937-907-714-684; 049-588-941-259-291; 052-049-890-123-815; 054-821-006-089-657; 059-209-256-633-978; 074-273-540-027-457; 077-178-012-975-940; 082-799-670-337-759; 083-550-441-011-985; 090-903-063-024-723; 101-053-057-295-518; 103-599-899-030-628; 111-703-198-749-063; 113-687-432-786-141; 118-047-621-693-135; 119-897-036-916-673; 128-857-740-178-213,1,true,,green

This will increase the satisfaction of customers due to providing their QoS requirements. The available solutions to this problem often seek to improve one of the criteria for service quality and use different methods to achieve this goal. This paper is aimed at offering an optimal solution to solve the task scheduling problem in the cloud environment using the firefly algorithm. The proposed algorithm helps not only to reduce the longest task completion time, but also to increase the utilization of virtual machines by taking into account the capabilities of each virtual machine and using the appropriate method for distributing virtual machine requests. Although, finding a proper task scheduling method is desirable, the correctness of this approach that can be checked by the automatic formal verification methods is a challenge. One of the most efficient method in this area is model checking which can verify the behavior of a system by checking some desired properties on the system model. Hence, we define a behavioral model of the task scheduling algorithm based on model checking techniques. To do so, we encode the algorithm to Abstract State Machine Metamodel-based Language (AsmetaL) and then some properties are defined for verifying the algorithm. The results obtained from the implementation of the proposed method show that the proposed method has an acceptable improvement for makespan and resource utilization.",,,664,669,Model checking; Formal verification; Scheduling (computing); Distributed computing; Firefly algorithm; Virtual machine; Computer science; Job shop scheduling; Correctness; Cloud computing,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/istel/istel2018.html#EbadifardDB18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/istel.2018.8661088,,10.1109/istel.2018.8661088,2921945847,,0,000-242-390-925-22X; 028-487-947-212-983; 034-480-352-787-505; 040-736-326-793-892; 052-522-335-651-759; 055-045-834-587-739; 062-652-112-433-912; 066-178-085-018-982,11,false,,

When the implementation is not done using a state machine interpreter, these notions had to be translated into the target language. This work aims to study how to translate as automatically as possible UML state diagrams into current objectoriented languages (OOLs), distinguishing sequential and concurrent execution. This translation requires to map UML notions onto OOLs ones, to adapt the abstract state machine, and to add information to state diagrams. Behavior inheritance is a key problem, and both theoretical and practical solutions are examined to ensure behavior substitutability.

A challenging problem in requirements modeling for real-time embedded software is to devise an easy-to-use formal requirements modeling language and a corresponding requirements modeling approach. Timed Abstract State Machine, abbreviated as TASM, is an easy-to-use formal requirements modeling language, but it has its limitations. We have extended TASM. In this paper, we propose an extended TASM-based requirements modeling approach for real-time embedded software to identify the parallel and hierarchical components, and describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. We apply the proposed approach to model requirements of actual real-time embedded software to validate its effectiveness. Our study highlights several lessons for modeling requirements of real-time embedded software in the extended TASM.",,,19,34,Software requirements specification; Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Embedded software; Modeling language; Systems engineering; Software; Computer science; Software requirements; Requirements analysis; Functional requirement,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-3482-4_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-3482-4_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-3482-4_2,,10.1007/978-981-10-3482-4_2,2576157757,,0,000-273-072-796-487; 003-373-022-532-528; 014-495-099-070-581; 036-745-033-619-698; 037-155-153-704-455; 067-907-776-455-19X; 072-659-327-044-492; 097-141-473-600-793; 113-846-857-354-585; 115-015-459-449-664; 125-479-003-125-926; 135-893-367-201-957; 137-512-192-126-932; 139-330-264-873-706; 139-573-023-308-243; 154-263-825-669-85X; 174-918-310-388-717; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

We developed a first-order temporal language, \(\cal{L}_{MDG}^*\), which expresses a subset of many-sorted first-order LTL and extends an earlier language, \(\cal{L}_{MDG}\), defined for an MDG based abstract CTL model checking. We derived a set of rules, enabling the transformation of \(\cal{L}_{MDG}^*\) formulas into generalized Buchi automata (GBA). The product of this GBA and the abstract state machine (ASM) model is checked for language emptiness. We have lifted two instances of the generalized Strongly Connected Component(SCC)-hull (GSH) checking algorithm [17] to support abstract data and uninterpreted functions based on operators available in the MDG package. Experimental results have shown the superiority of our tool compared to the same instances of GSH implemented with BDDs in VIS.",,,441,455,Model checking; Algorithm; Discrete mathematics; Kripke structure; Büchi automaton; Linear logic; Mathematics; Strongly connected component; Linear temporal logic; Abstract machine; Product (mathematics),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-30476-0_36 https://core.ac.uk/display/101244072 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-30476-0_36.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30476-0_36 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/atva/atva2004.html#WangTM04 http://hvg.ece.concordia.ca/Publications/Conferences/36_ATVA%2704.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30476-0_36,,10.1007/978-3-540-30476-0_36,1488810488,,0,003-658-186-760-235; 005-458-364-822-440; 020-764-558-292-184; 026-438-842-244-301; 028-395-176-951-113; 032-360-887-622-855; 032-703-995-573-28X; 038-436-944-637-372; 058-425-156-941-228; 063-894-547-984-041; 066-922-742-311-12X; 067-114-472-780-831; 073-258-060-458-846; 075-364-376-643-310; 077-879-266-917-259; 083-865-870-531-563; 085-647-232-787-131; 100-266-106-245-297; 105-400-100-990-778; 133-600-918-319-229; 148-002-145-228-257; 154-257-030-947-931; 161-012-419-671-353; 169-475-387-822-170; 188-398-898-461-306; 192-490-608-762-204,5,true,,green

The Abstract State Machine Theorem states that every classical algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to an abstract state machine. This theorem presupposes three natural postulates about algorithmic computation. Here, we show that augmenting those postulates with an additional requirement regarding basic operations gives a natural axiomatization of computability and a proof of Church's Thesis, as Godel and others suggested may be possible. In a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations, one can prove Turing's Thesis, characterizing the effective string functions, and—in particular—the effectively-computable functions on string representations of numbers.",14,3,299,350,Computability theory; μ-recursive function; Algebra; Computability; Algorithm characterizations; utm theorem; Turing machine; Computer science; Computable function; Church–Turing thesis,effective computation; recursiveness; computable functions; Church's Thesis; Turing's Thesis; abstract state machines; algorithms; encodings,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/188-a-natural-axiomatization-of-churchs-thesis/ http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/papers/Church.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/DERANA https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-symbolic-logic/volume-14/issue-3/A-natural-axiomatization-of-computability-and-proof-of-Churchs-Thesis/10.2178/bsl/1231081370.full http://engr.case.edu/ray_soumya/mlrg/CTthesis-proof_bsl08.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bsl/bsl14.html#DershowitzG08 https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A63FCE2FEF1F59E42FFFD5980451DB02/S1079898600001591a.pdf/div-class-title-a-natural-axiomatization-of-computability-and-proof-of-church-s-thesis-div.pdf https://doi.org/10.2178/bsl/1231081370 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/188-A-Natural-Axiomatization-of-Computability-and-Proof-of-Churchs-Thesis.pdf https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-symbolic-logic/article/natural-axiomatization-of-computability-and-proof-of-churchs-thesis/A63FCE2FEF1F59E42FFFD5980451DB02 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/Opera/188.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2178/bsl/1231081370,,10.2178/bsl/1231081370,2121136774,,0,000-452-980-157-289; 000-490-410-327-490; 000-745-232-131-816; 000-848-924-855-438; 001-155-622-988-90X; 001-332-641-484-998; 003-703-693-880-100; 004-511-981-278-405; 005-694-138-735-992; 006-123-740-083-381; 006-885-253-431-458; 008-328-610-164-089; 010-428-026-662-337; 011-052-400-879-696; 012-692-592-286-626; 015-263-850-899-542; 015-545-391-248-630; 015-940-092-888-179; 016-110-051-799-528; 017-119-407-730-546; 020-455-388-549-59X; 022-439-730-493-089; 023-356-507-873-233; 023-381-709-084-114; 026-671-476-867-357; 026-866-404-502-906; 028-826-512-349-757; 031-014-835-610-66X; 031-091-098-464-621; 031-909-553-637-650; 033-859-113-440-045; 034-141-805-902-697; 034-292-361-589-705; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-596-043-724-640; 039-338-372-562-025; 039-684-420-480-326; 041-406-781-361-711; 041-863-663-936-741; 048-161-579-385-623; 048-495-703-402-68X; 050-639-990-254-545; 053-956-836-134-180; 058-333-645-536-321; 060-733-812-776-088; 062-050-951-767-86X; 069-050-537-784-263; 071-062-211-635-76X; 075-726-279-151-424; 078-457-147-947-291; 080-124-501-272-546; 081-533-716-212-982; 081-564-980-994-874; 082-815-138-851-468; 085-568-322-618-811; 085-994-097-594-260; 089-355-190-014-421; 091-627-852-966-703; 091-938-225-239-994; 092-195-924-604-606; 094-605-927-503-95X; 094-722-028-432-118; 097-885-033-876-878; 099-637-042-899-342; 100-147-890-524-932; 100-481-746-689-744; 103-432-912-443-001; 104-924-219-415-405; 107-925-596-602-568; 111-567-034-049-446; 112-454-167-232-434; 118-838-030-263-345; 119-544-652-264-927; 120-263-822-258-648; 124-596-904-246-510; 126-998-030-149-801; 127-378-052-232-437; 129-892-066-656-075; 131-396-163-070-42X; 133-375-412-244-057; 135-653-596-353-169; 136-172-709-816-588; 137-848-674-073-887; 139-568-494-499-932; 146-836-542-531-151; 148-150-646-951-560; 156-636-121-714-183; 157-311-554-599-521; 162-442-853-238-997; 163-330-902-847-052; 163-714-037-994-834; 169-073-447-115-709; 172-419-564-595-602; 172-695-740-783-014; 178-558-813-883-946; 180-946-583-583-046; 187-371-742-557-006; 192-732-079-596-552; 195-635-564-405-355; 195-652-824-339-257; 198-078-863-486-538,112,true,,bronze

Specifically, we focus here on testing situation analysis decision support models for marine safety & security operations as a sample application domain. Arguably, methodical approaches for analyzing and validating situation analysis methods, decision support models, and information fusion algorithms require realistic vignettes that describe in great detail how a situation unfolds over time depending on initial configurations, dynamic environmental conditions and uncertain operational aspects. Meaningful results from simulation runs require appropriate test cases, the production of which is in itself a complex activity. To simplify this task, we introduce here the conceptual design of a Vignette Generator that has been developed and tested in an industrial research project.

Ejnioui; Carlos E. Otero; Abrar A. Qureshi,"The latest specification of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.x revised completely the structure and elements of sequence diagrams by expanding their modularity via interaction fragments. These fragments are based on a set of operators that can simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of events in the diagram. Unfortunately, the new revision introduced a significant degree of ambiguity in the interpretation of these diagrams. This ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that different styles of sequence diagrams can be used for different purposes of modeling and analysis. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. The approach in this paper assumes that lifeline processes in a sequence diagram act as autonomous agents that communicate by exchanging messages among each other in asynchronous and distributed manner. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and constraints.",,,71,76,Unified Modeling Language; Block diagram; Sequence diagram; Operational semantics; Story-driven modeling; Class diagram; Computer science; Communication diagram; Theoretical computer science; System sequence diagram,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2512209.2512211 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/riit/riit2013.html#EjniouiOQ13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2512209.2512211,,10.1145/2512209.2512211,1993758430,,0,012-032-484-394-263; 043-458-843-275-841; 069-632-731-573-953; 072-936-896-406-37X; 097-051-009-132-034; 125-735-518-317-29X; 139-330-264-873-706; 156-564-161-443-330; 159-976-005-385-976; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

Since such transformations are frequently integrated to design environments, they need to provide short reaction time to support software engineers. The objective of the VIATRA2 (VIsual Automated model TRAnsformations [9]) framework is to support the entire life-cycle of model transformations consisting of specification, design, execution, validation and maintenance. Model representation. VIATRA2 uses the VPM metamodeling approach [8] for describing modeling languages and models. The main reason for selecting VPM instead of a MOF-based metamodeling approach is that VPM supports arbitrary metalevels in the model space. As a direct consequence, models taken from conceptually different domains (and/or technological spaces) can be easily integrated into the VPM model space. The flexibility of VPM is demonstrated by a large number of already existing model importers accepting the models of different BPM formalisms, UML models of various tools, XSD descriptions, and EMF models. Graph transformation (GT) [3] based tools have been frequently used for specifying and executing complex model transformations. In GT tools, graph patterns capture structural conditions and type constraints in a compact visual way. At execution time, these conditions need to be evaluated by graph pattern matching, which aims to retrieve one or all matches of a given pattern to execute a transformation rule. A graph transformation rule declaratively specifies a model manipulation operation, that replaces a match of the LHS graph pattern with an image of the RHS pattern. Transformation description. Specification of model transformations in VIATRA2 combines the visual, declarative rule and pattern based paradigm of graph transformation and the very general, high-level formal paradigm of abstract state machines (ASM) [2] into a single framework for capturing transformations within and between modeling languages [7]. A transformation is defined by an ASM machine that may contain ASM rules (executable command sequences), graph patterns, GT rules, as well as ASM functions for temporary storage. An optional main rule can serve as entry point. For model manipulation and pattern matching, the transformation may rely on the metamodels available in the VPM model space; such references are made easier by namespace imports. Transformation Execution. Transformations are executed within the framework by using the VIATRA2 interpreter.

We show how features modularize program source, theorem statements and their proofs. By composing features, the source code, theorem statements and proofs for a program are assembled.

We present an improved algorithm which rectifies the weaknesses of the original algorithm, as well as a practical, fully functional choreography engine implementation in Flora-2 based on the improved algorithm. Our improvements to the choreography algorithm include (i) the linking of the initial state of the ASM to the precondition of the goal, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a final state in the execution of the ASM and its linking to the postcondition of the goal, and (iii) modification to the execution of the ASM so that it stops when the final state condition is satisfied by the current configuration of the machine. Our choreography engine takes as input semantic web service specifications written in the Flora-2 dialect of F-logic. Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of ASMs (evolving algebras) and evolving ontologies in the sense that one can simulate the other, a first in literature.

Due to the fact that the ASM approach defines a notion of executing specifications, it provides a perfect basis for a language, which can be used as a specification language as well as a high-level programming language. However, in order to upgrade to a realistic programming language, such a language must — besides other features — add a modularization concept to the core ASM constructs in order to provide the possibility to structure large-scale ASM-formalizations and to flexibly define reusable specification units. In this paper, the language Xasm, which stands for Extensible ASM, is presented. Xasm realizes a component-based modularization concept based on the notion of external functions as defined in ASMs. This paper also briefly describes the support environment of Xasm consisting of the Xasm-compiler translating Xasm programs to C source code, and the graphical debugging and animation tool.",,,69,90,Low-level programming language; Abstract state machines; Programming language specification; Debugging; Compiler; Component-based software engineering; High-level programming language; Programming language; Specification language; Language primitive; Runtime system; Extensibility; Computer science; Source code; Component (UML); First-generation programming language; Modular programming; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/57045635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6,127868156,,3,000-490-410-327-490; 008-851-666-443-606; 011-714-899-066-773; 019-043-895-820-341; 028-647-212-633-541; 032-014-692-842-661; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-198-279-045-712; 054-846-496-589-187; 069-180-238-940-145; 071-836-356-365-947; 073-111-177-402-911; 077-082-840-416-099; 079-723-355-085-863; 083-972-922-498-894; 094-512-586-911-230; 094-993-083-147-832; 104-538-400-674-182; 105-374-125-615-695; 105-620-622-527-144; 122-334-811-271-036; 138-788-046-637-498; 150-188-119-252-720; 151-880-343-919-54X; 155-219-003-803-384; 168-683-312-771-217; 171-752-315-748-404; 199-626-244-193-753,65,false,,

We propose a methodology based on the construction of a mathematical model which reflects the given system so closely that the correctness can be established by observation and experimentation (ground model). Complex technical systems are often heterogeneous, so that different system aspects are best modelled by means of different techniques. This leads to heterogeneous ground models. To achieve a consistent and coherent view of heterogeneous behavioural models, which is a prerequisite for any systematic analysis and validation, we introduce a common semantic framework (meta-model) based on the notion of Abstract State Machines. We exemplify our methodology by an industrial case study from automated manufacturing, the distributed control for a material flow system (MFS).",,,55,79,Formal verification; Formal specification; Computer Aided Design; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Computer-aided; Computer science; Simulation; Correctness; Formal methods; Abstract machine,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/eurocast/eurocast1999.html#CastilloG99 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F10720123_7 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/10720123_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/10720123_7,,10.1007/10720123_7,2131734358,,0,010-613-276-696-534; 013-790-960-098-756; 029-600-783-341-321; 030-266-627-017-428; 033-478-592-671-57X; 048-996-865-323-568; 050-468-192-551-533; 067-594-645-282-810; 068-779-176-505-512; 100-638-520-723-965; 105-620-622-527-144; 108-883-028-829-629; 112-323-824-635-381; 128-269-677-177-769; 157-311-554-599-521; 166-534-678-548-536; 191-925-997-526-005,2,false,,

This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment's replies but also the order in which the replies were received.",3,4,27,,Algorithm; Order (group theory); Basis (linear algebra); Abstract state machines; Cover (topology); Computer science; Interactive algorithm; Mathematics; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007arXiv0707.3782B/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3782 http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3782,http://dx.doi.org/10.2168/lmcs-3(4:3)2007,,10.2168/lmcs-3(4:3)2007,2134723009; 3103588562,,0,000-745-232-131-816; 002-850-742-565-267; 011-052-400-879-696; 031-909-553-637-650; 034-400-132-510-675; 037-445-945-364-220; 038-807-701-463-486; 053-011-889-759-632; 062-664-349-916-689; 069-050-537-784-263; 080-514-932-964-257; 080-599-291-933-826; 081-328-440-016-426; 085-568-322-618-811; 092-195-924-604-606; 098-178-923-588-572; 101-757-571-469-395; 121-654-056-867-886; 127-265-490-736-503; 133-375-412-244-057; 150-742-788-253-697; 153-239-058-339-73X; 159-279-984-641-596; 189-521-689-083-502,25,true,cc-by,gold

We use the ASM methodology to give the dynamic semantics of the functional programming language Standard ML.

Khan; Sofiène Tahar; Otmane Ait Mohamed; Ali Habibi,"To specify, design, and implement complex system-on-chip (SoC), a new modeling method, transaction level modeling (TLM), has been proposed recently. TLM allows designers to focus on functionality while abstracting implementation details. At the register transfer level (RTL), however, different modules communicate through detailed pin level signaling. SoC design methodologies involve the integration of different intellectual property (IP) blocks modeled at different levels of abstraction. Therefore a special module or channel is needed in order to link modules, IPs, designed at different abstraction levels. This module, called transactor, can be modeled using a finite state machine (FSM) providing a functional specification of the protocol's behavior. In this paper, we propose a methodology to specify transactors using graphical finite state machine (FSM). This technique enables an automatic generation of SystemC TLM-RTL transactors via an intermediate translation of the user-defined FSM to the Abstract State Machines Language (AsmL). The UTOPIA standard protocol is provided as an illustration of this approach.",,,257,260,Abstract state machines; Embedded system; Logic synthesis; Finite-state machine; Transaction-level modeling; SystemC; Register-transfer level; Computer science; Functional specification; Protocol (object-oriented programming),,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004497706 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4497706/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icm.2007.4497706,,10.1109/icm.2007.4497706,2541480683,,0,053-230-392-967-84X; 094-771-146-000-368; 097-222-587-214-430; 136-803-665-616-08X; 139-330-264-873-706; 178-571-591-291-991; 195-771-205-843-317,1,false,,

A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the ''everything is a model'' principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or WebML.",70,1,62,86,Software engineering; Web application; Web modeling; Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Programming language; Decoupling (probability); Reuse; Computer science; Weaving; Metamodeling,Abstract state machines; Model transformations; Model weaving; Web applications; Metamodel specification,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82464042 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp70.html#CicchettiR08 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:679443 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642307001566 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002,,10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002,1994426217,,0,003-601-413-754-373; 005-460-957-985-387; 006-017-693-692-950; 007-123-372-908-904; 008-015-330-076-941; 010-193-530-630-533; 010-731-917-239-059; 011-895-798-909-79X; 012-762-503-620-399; 013-352-634-535-287; 013-373-940-400-826; 014-875-365-850-914; 020-013-882-140-265; 028-576-186-413-880; 029-943-697-329-478; 031-266-755-714-363; 032-612-267-314-323; 037-812-871-655-069; 043-956-404-991-194; 045-062-382-799-07X; 053-631-785-808-409; 054-180-513-727-222; 055-611-152-010-311; 060-733-812-776-088; 060-754-234-319-426; 064-171-683-967-366; 064-397-334-771-009; 076-767-312-466-020; 077-081-857-656-756; 077-951-050-880-059; 081-533-568-202-802; 082-714-949-563-192; 082-867-331-821-855; 100-011-765-145-332; 105-956-396-632-251; 109-181-626-246-60X; 116-956-993-545-841; 121-108-933-012-073; 123-381-573-865-362; 124-736-384-157-830; 129-399-852-618-27X; 134-007-742-290-854; 135-695-271-107-707; 145-070-700-492-395; 147-500-061-251-762; 155-855-852-192-343; 161-197-795-750-614; 162-035-724-191-880; 163-880-481-558-215; 171-937-152-425-23X; 174-005-299-118-911; 175-872-624-816-96X; 195-946-411-840-792; 199-111-743-234-174,19,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

By continuity, the value of the functional on a given function depends only on a ``critical"" finite part of this function. Care: there is in general no way to compute this critical finite part without querying the function on an arbitrarily larger finite part! Nevertheless, things are different in case there is a uniform bound on the size of the domain of this critical finite part. We prove that, modulo a quadratic blow-up of the bound, one can compute the value of the functional by an algorithm which queries the input function on a uniformly bounded finite part. Up to a constant factor, this quadratic blow-up is optimal. We also characterize such functionals in topological terms using uniformities. As an application of these results, we get a topological characterization of the dynamics of algorithms as modeled by Gurevich's Abstract State Machines.",,,345,354,Algorithm; Quadratic equation; Baire space; Mathematics; Bounded function; Domain (mathematical analysis); Computable function; Modulo; Function (mathematics); Uniform boundedness,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/LICS.2012.45 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006280453 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6280453/ https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/LICS.2012.45 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6280453/ https://www.irif.fr/~seg/_2012LICS/GRIGORIEFF_VALARCHER_2012_LICS_DynamicsOfAlgo.pdf http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~seg/_2012LICS/GRIGORIEFF_VALARCHER_2012_LICS_DynamicsOfAlgo.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/lics/lics2012.html#GrigorieffV12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/lics.2012.45,,10.1109/lics.2012.45,2086445037,,0,007-883-129-081-670; 012-866-075-792-173; 023-932-678-004-182; 034-400-132-510-675; 040-104-460-460-911; 080-313-281-594-764; 085-881-043-181-689; 091-938-225-239-994; 092-195-924-604-606; 131-134-695-383-398; 160-403-690-462-163; 178-681-821-595-577; 180-995-527-106-385; 196-172-731-112-698,1,false,,

The early validation of ASM models would help reduce the cost and risk of having defects propagate, through refinement, to other models, and eventually to code; thus, adversely affecting the quality of the end product. Mutation testing is a well-established fault-based technique for assessing and improving the quality of test suites. However, little research has been devoted to mutation analysis in the context of ASMs. Mutation testing is known to be computationally expensive due to the large number of generated mutants that are executed against a test set. In this study, the authors empirically investigate the application of cost reduction strategies to AsmetaL, an ASM-based formal language. Furthermore, they evaluate experimentally the effectiveness and the savings resulting from applying two techniques: namely, random mutants selection and operator-based selective mutation, in the context of the AsmetaL language. The quantitative results show that both techniques achieved good savings without major impact on effectiveness.",11,6,292,300,Mutation (genetic algorithm); Machine learning; Abstract state machines; Formal language; Artificial intelligence; Finite-state machine; Test set; Cost reduction; Context (language use); Computer science; Selection (genetic algorithm),,,,King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals,https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-sen.2015.0030 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/iet-sen/iet-sen11.html#AlkrarhaH17 https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-sen.2015.0030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-sen.2015.0030,,10.1049/iet-sen.2015.0030,2572916897,,0,000-777-738-898-770; 004-792-725-713-379; 005-627-941-527-420; 021-003-498-716-896; 027-328-714-019-328; 032-036-176-853-708; 041-440-468-322-280; 043-610-051-086-712; 045-327-642-894-024; 050-578-715-624-648; 050-999-068-227-763; 053-026-337-197-522; 054-850-488-213-958; 060-510-961-866-732; 068-692-482-243-379; 078-493-960-426-77X; 081-190-127-139-738; 085-278-493-726-942; 105-107-714-380-808; 107-319-875-627-004; 123-476-510-454-269; 124-539-027-121-618; 139-330-264-873-706; 141-738-939-236-23X; 141-947-476-011-755; 142-796-277-058-711; 166-187-638-953-760,0,true,cc-by,gold

This may lead to surprising results not anticipated by the programmer. The problem is exacerbated by common compiler and hardware optimization techniques. A memory (consistency) model provides a contract between the system designer and the software designer that constrains the order in which operations are observed. Every memory model strikes some balance between strictness (simplifying program behavior) and laxness (permitting greater optimization).; ; With its emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, the Java programming language needs a memory model that is satisfactory to language users and implementors. Everyone in the Java community must be able to understand the Java memory model and its ramifications. The description of the original Java memory model suffered from ambiguity and opaqueness, and attempts to interpret it revealed serious deficiencies. Two memory models have been proposed as replacements. Unfortunately, these two new models are described at different levels of abstraction and are represented in different formats, making it difficult to compare them. In this paper we formalize these models and develop a unified representation of them, using Abstract State Machines. Using our formal specifications, we relate the new Java memory models to the Location Consistency memory model and to each other.",2589,,166,185,Scala; Memory model; Real time Java; Shared memory; Java annotation; Compiler; Generics in Java; strictfp; Java concurrency; Optimizing compiler; Programming language; Programmer; Computer science; Multiprocessing; Java; Java Modeling Language; Abstract machine; Distributed memory; Java Memory Model,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_9 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_9 http://cs.sookmyung.ac.kr/~chang/java/varsha.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/24304671 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#AwhadW03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_9,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_9,2155244944,,0,003-222-418-546-848; 004-479-156-276-701; 011-919-743-722-067; 019-472-104-625-693; 020-579-587-866-103; 023-299-224-157-984; 026-924-949-195-11X; 031-203-850-407-769; 034-728-900-389-951; 041-863-663-936-741; 055-426-770-822-814; 057-009-218-468-036; 059-553-350-068-285; 061-388-520-187-873; 070-081-648-718-75X; 072-682-264-955-701; 073-111-177-402-911; 076-432-416-285-182; 076-805-810-934-32X; 077-661-241-991-477; 078-527-782-859-515; 084-403-590-680-96X; 099-851-634-677-214; 105-620-622-527-144; 116-369-894-387-853; 119-165-273-849-503; 119-426-806-834-674; 122-322-242-208-513; 127-079-227-441-119; 132-648-525-845-187; 134-465-338-153-91X; 141-958-568-357-845; 149-490-863-737-015; 178-855-395-032-583; 195-635-564-405-355,4,false,,

ASMs gained much attention as a specification method. It is extremely flexible because any mathematical structure may serve as a state. Gurevich characterized the expressive power of ASMs in terms of intuitively convincing postulates. The core result of this paper shows that the next-state function M of an Abstract State Machine M can be described on a symbolic level, notwithstanding the generality of the model: The successor state M(S) of a state S is fully specified by the equivalence ~""S induced by S on the terms over the signature of M. Consequently, M(S) is computable in case ~""S is decidable.

We perform scheduling and allocation on this IR, and generate synthesizable VHDL. We have the following advantages when using ASMs as an IR: 1) it allows the specification of both sequential and parallel computation, 2) it supports an extension of a clean timing model based on an interpretation of the sequential semantics, and 3) it has well-defined formal semantics, which allows the integration of formal methods into the methodology. While we specify our designs using ASMs, we do not mandate this. Instead, one can create translators that convert the algorithmic specifications from C-like languages into their equivalent ASM specifications. This makes the hardware synthesis transparent to the designer. We experiment our methodology with examples of a FIR, microprocessor, and an edge detecteor. We synthesize these designs and validate our designs on an FPGA.",,,1,6,Formal specification; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Finite-state machine; Programming language; VHDL; Computer science; Hardware description language; Field-programmable gate array; High-level synthesis; Formal methods; Intermediate language; Semantics of logic,,,,,https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rsinha/research/pubs/date2011.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/date/date2011.html#SinhaP11 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5763227/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/date.2011.5763227,,10.1109/date.2011.5763227,2117703006,,3,021-672-197-345-911; 045-930-416-342-455; 060-776-050-843-781; 070-834-845-151-602; 072-782-888-636-23X; 077-492-877-531-383; 136-058-395-694-880; 190-415-617-582-392,4,false,,

On one hand, this is due to the intrinsic complexity of the methods and, therefore, some level of required expertise is unavoidable. On the other hand, however, the methods are sometimes hard to use because of lack of a user-friendly tool support. In this paper, we present our experience in addressing usability when developing a framework for the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formal method. In particular, we discuss how we enhanced modeling, validation, and verification activities of an ASM-based development process.

It can not effectively determine the size and position of the graphic display, and it is difficult to effectively support the graphic language layout control. Therefore, this paper proposes a new automatic graphic language arrangement algorithm in visual communication design. Through the fixed value method to calculate the display size of buffer image in visual communication design, the minimum number of layout layout and the maximum surface utilization are taken as the layout objective function; the ant colony algorithm is used to solve the problem, and the optimal solution is obtained to obtain the best display position of the graphics in visual communication design. The description of graphic language is realized by syntax description based on rules and semantic description based on ASM (abstract state machine).

Recently, it was shown that non-deterministic database transformations can be captured exactly by a variant of ASMs, the so-called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs). In this article we present a logic for DB-ASMs, extending the logic of Nanchen and Stärk for ASMs. In particular, we develop a rigorous proof system for the logic for DB-ASMs, which is proven to be sound and complete. The most difficult challenge to be handled by the extension is a proper formalization capturing non-determinism of database transformations and all its related features such as consistency, update sets or multisets associated with DB-ASM rules. As the database part of a state of database transformations is a finite structure and DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers only over the database part of a state, we resolve this problem by taking update sets explicitly into the logic, i.e. by using an additional modal operator $[X]$, where $X$ is interpreted as an update set $\Delta$ generated by a DB-ASM rule. The DB-ASM logic provides a powerful verification tool to study properties of database transformations.</jats:p>",25,5,700,740,Programming language; Computer science; State (computer science),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/igpl/igpl25.html#FerrarottiSTW17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jigpal/jzx021,,10.1093/jigpal/jzx021,2962981453,,0,001-747-172-884-562; 003-435-477-456-120; 010-262-461-233-214; 019-928-127-712-91X; 021-424-988-248-007; 025-221-133-034-80X; 028-123-482-947-439; 033-195-370-790-75X; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-807-701-463-486; 039-461-346-794-31X; 044-328-373-269-72X; 044-615-296-813-163; 050-995-433-771-903; 058-974-031-275-841; 062-360-840-957-47X; 062-933-884-590-564; 064-863-740-912-618; 070-939-722-966-976; 073-662-635-983-583; 077-321-006-820-298; 092-195-924-604-606; 100-117-771-848-697; 103-402-250-763-040; 105-802-336-877-837; 108-407-058-774-182; 111-865-895-679-461; 122-625-102-813-007; 122-748-228-161-972; 124-984-484-040-077; 139-330-264-873-706; 151-727-740-773-571; 155-595-721-116-385; 168-196-175-947-627,14,true,,green

We argue that with respect to compiler correctness this is the best possible result which can be achieved in practice. Such a compiler may even include unverified code provided the results of such code can be proven correct independently from how they are generated.We then show how abstract state machines (ASMs) can be used to uniformly describe the dynamic semantics of the programs being compiled across the various intermediate transformation steps occurring within a compiler.

They abstract however almost entirely from a notion of system state. The method of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) offers powerful abstraction and refinement techniques for specifying system dynamics based upon a most general notion of structured state. The evolutions of the state are governed however by a fixed and typically unstructured program, called 'rule', which describes a set of abstract updates occurring simultaneously at each step (synchronous parallelism).

This proposal enables the integration of SystemC with existing tools for test case generation from FSM. Hence, enabling two important applications: (1) using the FSM graph structure to produce test suites allowing functional testing of SystemC designs; and (2) performing conformance testing, where the FSM serves as a precise model of the observable behavior of the system used to validate lower abstraction levels of the design (e.g., Register Transfer Level (RTL)).",2,,76,81,Formal verification; System on a chip; Abstract state machines; Abstraction layer; Finite-state machine; Parallel computing; Programming language; SystemC; Register-transfer level; Computer science; System testing; Conformance testing; Functional testing,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000001657118 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1657118/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/date/date2006.html#HabibiMT06 http://hvg.ece.concordia.ca/Publications/Conferences/14_DATE%2706.pdf https://www.date-conference.com/proceedings-archive/PAPERS/2006/DATE06/DF_FILES/06D_2.PDF,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/date.2006.243777,,10.1109/date.2006.243777,2100889455,,0,029-858-763-538-985; 050-468-192-551-533; 050-578-715-624-648; 127-727-875-983-808; 128-269-677-177-769; 142-952-774-773-590; 160-444-978-513-100,38,false,,

Their formal background makes them suited for proofs, their refinement design method eases the system engineering and their apparent simplicity steepens the end user's learning curve. The numerous extensions that followed have adapted the ASMs to most of the real-time system needs. Our aim is to provide a safe, precise and adaptable worst-case execution time (WCET) estimation for processors featuring modern components. The safety property implies that among all the possible processor states, generated by the binary for all possible inputs, the ones that cause the maximal execution time must be considered. However, complex architectural components, designed to speedup the average case, make it impossible to infer local timing decisions to the global systems as the monotony is broken by the timing anomalies. Therefore, a large number of states must be analysed, generating a combinatorial explosion. Our approach starts with a value analysis of the binary code performed by abstract interpretation. The inherent imprecision of its results is taken into account by the initially concrete abstract state machine processor model. Through the use of an internal oracle, it can dynamically adapt to the lack or imprecision of information by choosing a different hierarchy level for all the impacted components. This kind of execution optimises the granularity of the run based on several strategies. State merging is also used, in order to further counter the state space explosion, in the detriment of precision. The merging is based on identified similar states through the use of equivalence classes. This also offers a leverage on the tradeoff between the precision and scalability of the analysis. Time, different abstraction levels of the processor during the same run and symbolic execution are directly added in the ASM model, as opposed to other approaches. This provides us with the needed architectural adaptability and full control over the main target of the analysis: precise WCET estimation. Taking into account a new processor becomes an engineering task as a new model for the processor is given in our extension of the ASM, with little syntactical differences. This in made possible by the seamless integration of the WCET estimation alongside the ASM semantics, which must not be changed whenever a new platform is considered.",,,,,Computer engineering; Combinatorial explosion; Abstract state machines; Symbolic execution; Abstract interpretation; Computer science; Scalability; Oracle; Binary code; Speedup; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214957/document https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214957,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214957,,,2740888784,,0,,0,false,,

We argue that with respect to compiler correctness this is the best possible result which can be achieved in practice. Such a compiler may even include unverified code provided the results of such code can be proven correct independently from how they are generated.We then show how abstract state machines (ASMs) can be used to uniformly describe the dynamic semantics of the programs being compiled across the various intermediate transformation steps occurring within a compiler.

Most noticeably, the FSM model for a particular testing problem may not be the most natural one to describe the implementation under test.

We use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method to provide a complete specification of the standard. The model has been developed through a sequence of model refinement steps following the incremental way in which requirements describe train operation.

093-533-228-889-404,"Rigorous State-Based Methods - 7th International Conference, {ABZ} 2020, Ulm, Germany, May 27-29, 2020, Proceedings",2020-05-27,2020,book,,,,,Alexander Raschke; Dominique Méry; Frank Houdek,"The International Conference on Rigorous State-based Methods (ABZ 2020) is an international forum for the cross-fertilization of related state-based and machine-based formal methods, mainly Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA+, VDM and Z. Rigorous state-based methods share common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The name ABZ was invented at the first conference held in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series merged into a single event. The second ABZ 2010 conference was held in Orford (Canada), where the Alloy community joined the event; ABZ 2012 was held in Pisa (Italy), which saw the inclusion of the VDM community (but not in the title); ABZ 2014 was held in Toulouse (France), which brought the inclusion of the TLA+ community into the ABZ conference series. Lastly, ABZ 2016 conference was held in Linz, Austria and ABZ 2018 in Southampton, UK. In 2018 the steering committee decided to retain the (well-known) acronym ABZ and add the subtitle ``International Conference on Rigorous State-Based Methods'' to make more explicit the intention to include all state-based formal methods. Started 2014 in Toulouse, each ABZ asked for the application of formal specifications on industrial case studies. This year, we extend the previous areas (aerospace, medical equipment, rails) with the automotive domain. A specification of an adaptive light and speed control system similar to the available real systems was provided by Frank Houdek, who also answered almost a hundred questions and gave clarifying explanations, for which we would like to thank him. The objective of these case studies is to provide an opportunity to demonstrate the applicability of the ABZ methods to real examples and also to allow a better comparison of the them. ABZ 2020 received 55 submissions from 21 countries around the world. The selection process was rigorous, where each paper received at least three reviews. The program committee, after careful discussions, decided to accept 12 full research papers, 6 case study papers and 9 short research papers. One extended abstract of one of the keynote speakers and one invited research paper are also included in the proceedings. All accepted papers cover broad research areas on both theoretical, systems and practical aspects of state-based methods. For the first time in ABZ series, in 2020 a doctoral symposium is organized and PhD students had to submit a short paper presenting their PhD topics; those 6 submissions have been evaluated by a separate PC committee including the two chairs of ABZ. The conference was to be held on May 27-29, 2020 in Ulm, Germany, but due to the historical crisis caused by the corona virus with an unprecedented international lock-down, travel-restrictions, and sadly many deaths around the world, we had to cancel the conference and postpone it to next year 2021. At ABZ 2021, all authors of accepted papers of ABZ 2020 are requested to present their research in addition to the new accepted papers. We are honored that all three distinguished guests as keynote speakers have agreed to give their keynotes next year: Ana Cavalcanti, University of York, York, UK, will give a talk entitled ``RoStar technology --- a roboticist's toolbox for combined proof and sound simulation''; Uwe Glasser, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, CA, will give a talk entitled ``Quantifying Uncertainty in ASM Models with Markov Processes'' and Gilles Dowek, INRIA/ENS Paris-Saclay, France. The EasyChair conference management system was set up for ABZ 2020, supporting submission, review and volume edition processes. We acknowledge it is an outstanding tool for the academic community. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted their work to ABZ 2020. We are grateful to the program committee members and external reviewers for their high-quality reviews and discussions. Finally, we wish to thank the Organizing Committee members for their continuous support. We hope the corona crisis will be over within the next weeks or months and that the enormous economic consequences of this crisis will be outweighed by more humanity in the world. We are looking forward to welcoming many conference attendants in Ulm next year and hope they will enjoy the technical program, informal meetings, and interactions with colleagues from all over the world; and of course, we are confident they will like the city of Ulm, Germany. For readers of these proceedings, we hope these papers are interesting and they inspire ideas for future research.",,12071,,,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Inclusion (education); Library science; Political science; State (polity); Toolbox; Subtitle; Acronym; Formal methods,,,,,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02999312,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02999312,,,3174621930,,0,,0,false,,

However the reactive approaches are usually tightly coupled to a particular embodiment making transfer of knowledge difficult. This paper proposes a paradigm for modeling and execution of reactive manipulation actions, which makes knowledge transfer to different embodiments possible while retaining the reactive capabilities of the embodiments. The proposed approach extends the idea of control primitives coordinated by a state machine by introducing an embodiment independent layer of abstraction. Abstract manipulation primitives constitute a vocabulary of atomic, embodiment independent actions, which can be coordinated using state machines to describe complex actions. To obtain embodiment specific models, the abstract state machines are automatically translated to embodiment specific models, such that full capabilities of each platform can be utilized. The strength of the manipulation primitives paradigm is demonstrated by developing a set of corresponding embodiment specific primitives for object transport, including a complex reactive grasping primitive. The robustness of the approach is experimentally studied in emptying of a box filled with several unknown objects. The embodiment independence is studied by performing a manipulation task on two different platforms using the same abstract description.",61,3,283,296,Human–computer interaction; Abstract state machines; Abstraction layer; Artificial intelligence; Finite-state machine; Set (abstract data type); Task (computing); Computer science; Abstraction (linguistics); Object (computer science); Robustness (computer science),,,,,http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/handle/10234/84089 http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/bitstream/10234/84089/3/58309%281%29.pdf https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications/manipulation-primitives-a-paradigm-for-abstraction-and-execution-of-grasping-and-manipulation-tasks(6d112984-5669-4517-8baf-87bc8e4be617).html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889012002217 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2012.11.010 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889012002217#! https://core.ac.uk/display/61429776 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2012.11.010 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2012.11.010 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ras/ras61.html#FelipLMK13 https://core.ac.uk/download/61429776.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2012.11.010,,10.1016/j.robot.2012.11.010,2027071444,,1,001-928-472-309-300; 004-297-924-157-717; 006-880-829-977-590; 008-972-494-475-011; 011-077-811-054-382; 013-203-242-314-494; 016-493-477-401-805; 026-439-993-917-707; 029-519-769-862-130; 031-679-315-967-039; 031-804-536-134-866; 032-668-516-476-773; 041-610-071-541-900; 053-955-820-918-963; 066-964-109-362-031; 066-991-047-051-599; 068-041-387-381-811; 069-399-081-438-259; 075-514-704-799-797; 077-091-508-463-234; 086-907-600-955-632; 089-312-012-477-829; 092-139-020-409-932; 102-010-386-119-845; 103-166-807-675-979; 116-357-396-234-936; 119-707-859-986-728; 122-533-377-016-885; 130-151-941-734-05X; 131-216-989-094-427; 137-681-539-641-19X; 141-127-744-083-488; 141-307-011-595-847; 143-612-702-927-277; 153-947-718-537-895; 160-129-425-564-485; 160-975-442-652-260; 164-934-329-584-299; 169-739-896-833-368,29,true,cc0,green

The framework itself is the reduced product of two abstract interpretations: (1) an abstract state machine and (2) a set of propositions in a restricted first-order logic.

LFA achieves this by delegating a given task to either the prover or the flow analysis depending on which is best suited to discharge it.

ASMs are typically infinite state systems and the problem of extracting a finite abstraction, the true FSM, from an ASM with respect to a given abstraction function is in general undecidable. To approximate the true FSM we utilize the two key features of ASMs, that they are executable and have precise mathematical semantics that allows for a symbolic representation of the overall system behavior. On one hand, executability of ASMs is exploited for true computation path exploration; this yields an under-approximation of the true FSM. On the other hand, the symbolic representation of the system behavior enables us to use theorem proving to exclude impossible computation paths; this yields an over-approximation of the true FSM. In this paper we discuss an algorithm that combines both into a unified approach.",,,86,91,Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Richards controller; State diagram; Finite-state machine; Extended finite-state machine; Undecidable problem; Virtual finite-state machine; Mathematics; Finite state machine with datapath; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scesm03.pdf https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=77820 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/combined-algorithm-for-approximating-a-finite-state-abstraction-of-a-large-system/ http://www.mi.ras.ru/~rey/papers/scesm03.pdf,https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=77820,,,158277950,,0,006-555-745-475-703; 008-638-531-729-145; 012-097-953-073-217; 012-602-715-464-540; 050-578-715-624-648; 052-766-080-234-187; 080-776-799-398-806; 104-639-774-082-491; 155-304-026-125-99X; 155-508-868-821-427; 159-618-853-125-78X; 176-197-240-615-472; 194-589-331-287-190,6,false,,

In this note we characterize ground models, whose epistemological role for a foundation of system design resembles the one Aristotle assigned to axioms to ground science in reality, avoiding infinite regress. We explain how ASM ground models help to resolve two major problems of requirements engineering, providing means a) to obtain for complex computer-based systems an adequate understanding by humans, and b) to cope with ever-changing requirements by faithfully capturing and tracing them via well-documented modeling-for-change.

We aim to remain as close as possible to the standard definition of UML and to cover the operational part of the language with particular attention to the behavior description based on actions. To remain close to the standard UML, we automatically translate the UML metamodel in ASM. This allows to take into account all the concepts and relationships contained in the standard, and to minimize the changes subsequent to the frequent updates of the standard.; ; For the dynamic part, the particularity of our approach is that we focus on actions, as defined in our proposal to the OMG action semantics working group. We deal with concurrency, signal exchange, operation calls, general communication primitives, etc. We do not define the semantics of state machines, but we clearly define their place within the framework of our semantics.

Among the existing development methodologies the iterative and incremental one has been proved to be efficient for system development but lacks of support for an adequate verification process. When considering Algebraic Petri nets (APNs) for modeling and model checking for verification, all the proofs must be redone after each iteration which is impractical both in terms of time and space.

It gives programmers more challenges than ever before. In this paper we propose Parallel Abstract State Machines (P-ASMs) that can empower programmers, no matter how experienced, by providing a well-founded systems engineering method to model data-parallel computations at arbitrary levels of abstraction. Particularly, we focus on discussing how P-ASMs can capture two classes of data-parallel computations that are most important in practice --- ones that are always-consistent and ones that require transactional data consistency.",,,136,150,Consistency (database systems); Transaction data; Abstract state machines; Parallel computing; Programming language; Distributed transaction; Programming paradigm; Focus (computing); Computer science; Computation; Abstraction (linguistics),,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_11 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/thalheim2012.html#Wang12 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-28279-9_11.pdf https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/29752 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/29752 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-28279-9_11 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_11,,10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_11,45043279,,0,015-491-312-666-973; 022-110-370-399-123; 026-982-370-494-466; 029-213-608-013-056; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-367-962-903-499; 035-401-224-135-906; 036-662-144-277-340; 043-767-335-593-658; 057-681-648-227-748; 059-428-948-884-153; 077-321-006-820-298; 082-748-136-701-581; 097-767-652-460-17X; 098-289-922-521-036; 112-657-830-852-577; 120-167-851-061-705; 128-530-456-729-474; 134-909-827-411-080; 136-762-110-027-451; 137-292-579-653-532; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-019-981-692-623; 152-406-246-728-774; 153-938-399-325-742; 164-759-049-606-048; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

Habibi; Sofiène Tahar; Otmane Ait Mohamed,"The SoC design flow consists of different levels of abstraction. At Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) different modules communicate with each other through function calls. In contrast, at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), different modules communicate through pin level signaling. The notion of transactors has been introduced recently in order to link modules (IP blocks) written at different levels of abstraction. A transactor can be modeled using a finite state machines (FSM) describing the functional protocol behaviors. In this paper, we propose to specify transactor behavior using the Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL). We also define a methodology and a tool that automatically generates SystemC TLM-RTL transactors from these AsmL specifications.

The framework itself is the reduced product of two abstract interpretations: (1) an abstract state machine and (2) a set of propositions in a restricted first-order logic. The motivating application for LFA is the safe removal of implicit array-bounds checks without type information, user interaction or program annotation. LFA achieves this by delegating a given task to either the prover or the flow analysis depending on which is best suited to discharge it.

As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed modeling languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to structure state and behavior aspects of specifications. Modern object-oriented languages offer a variety of advanced language constructs, and most of them either offer interfaces, mixins, or traits in addition to classes and inheritance. Our goal is to investigate these language constructs in the context of state-based formal methods using ASMs as a representative of this kind of formal methods. We report on a controlled experiment with 105 participants to study the understandability of the three language constructs in the context of ASMs. Our hypotheses are influenced by the debate of object-oriented communities. We hypothesized that the understandability (measured by correctness and duration variables) shows significantly better understanding for interfaces and traits compared to mixins, as well as at least a similar or better understanding for traits compared to interfaces. The results indicate that understandability of interfaces and traits show a similar good understanding, whereas mixins shows a poorer understanding. We found a significant difference for the correctness of understanding comparing interfaces with mixins.",178,,110987,,Variety (cybernetics); Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Programming language; Context (language use); Inheritance (object-oriented programming); Computer science; Language construct; Correctness; Formal methods,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000844 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121221000844 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jss/jss178.html#PaulweberSZ21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.110987,,10.1016/j.jss.2021.110987,3158802137,,0,000-180-584-220-147; 000-987-649-080-323; 003-131-921-427-332; 004-296-789-760-892; 004-877-171-081-463; 006-635-819-665-420; 010-852-259-152-365; 011-283-753-736-189; 011-882-730-843-904; 012-907-323-841-949; 015-980-044-239-197; 016-446-377-960-149; 018-369-083-778-030; 019-113-402-382-947; 021-518-769-824-032; 021-785-921-993-647; 023-186-040-384-436; 027-244-737-862-440; 028-157-911-232-198; 029-858-763-538-985; 030-219-725-823-27X; 032-534-780-514-907; 032-995-100-169-946; 033-538-264-444-978; 034-400-132-510-675; 034-542-802-471-470; 034-621-810-710-916; 038-014-431-396-278; 038-864-372-635-54X; 045-327-642-894-024; 046-216-399-297-450; 047-682-196-320-651; 054-230-259-110-181; 055-042-610-674-194; 057-648-310-683-602; 059-975-823-275-808; 060-776-050-843-781; 062-405-632-629-574; 062-961-043-503-946; 064-951-343-916-228; 070-966-415-052-115; 071-180-469-577-920; 073-682-597-789-568; 076-967-105-634-518; 077-754-909-759-890; 081-548-603-926-788; 082-597-956-517-75X; 082-714-949-563-192; 092-597-199-745-554; 096-239-462-922-956; 096-593-721-066-122; 097-238-938-679-966; 099-482-594-708-125; 100-162-484-718-18X; 105-471-755-947-795; 106-113-148-648-052; 114-573-855-811-418; 115-111-392-439-540; 121-585-378-610-438; 134-048-117-134-427; 142-244-472-246-595; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-040-306-323-729; 151-202-864-876-079; 159-497-134-948-087; 177-650-293-874-944; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502; 192-651-528-538-864; 195-635-564-405-355; 196-789-941-898-801,8,true,cc-by,hybrid

In this paper we propose a technique to perform automatic review of Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal specifications. We first detect a family of typical vulnerabilities and defects a developer can introduce during the modeling activity using the ASMs and we express such faults as the violation of meta-properties that guarantee certain quality attributes of the specification. These meta-properties are then mapped to temporal logic formulas and model checked for their violation. As a proof of concept, we also report the result of applying this ASM review process to several specifications.",,,4,13,Formal specification; Proof of concept; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Temporal logic; System development; Review process; Computer science,,,,,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20100018554/downloads/20100018554.pdf https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/154546 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/564316 https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/nfm10.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/25160 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100018554.pdf https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/154546/2/NASA-CP-2010-216215.pdf https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/NFM2010/talks/arcaini.pdf https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/NFM2010/papers/nfm2010_4_13.pdf,https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/154546,,,2183365895,,0,032-354-281-297-321; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-533-472-164-312; 040-736-326-793-892; 062-778-162-008-686; 064-890-246-394-724; 069-561-131-419-172; 082-000-720-773-277; 117-861-031-589-813; 140-817-112-090-657; 155-426-160-695-761; 189-521-689-083-502,28,false,,

Only a few of these specifications are executable, although there are several interpreters and some compilers. This paper introduces a compilation scheme to transform an ASM specification in the syntax of the ASM-Workbench into C++. In particular, we transform algebraic types, pattern matching, functional expressions, dynamic functions, and simultaneous updates to C++ code. The main aim of this compilation scheme is to preserve the specification structure in the generated code without generating inefficient code.

As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to express structural and behavioral aspects of specifications. Our goal is to investigate object-oriented abstractions such as interfaces and traits for ASM-based specification languages. We report on a controlled experiment with 98 participants to study the specification efficiency and effectiveness in which participants needed to comprehend an informal specification as problem (stimulus) in form of a textual description and express a corresponding solution in form of a textual ASM specification using either interface or trait syntax extensions. The study was carried out with a completely randomized design and one alternative (interface or trait) per experimental group. The results indicate that specification effectiveness of the traits experiment group shows a better performance compared to the interfaces experiment group, but specification efficiency shows no statistically significant differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study studying the specification effectiveness and efficiency of object-oriented abstractions in the context of formal methods.",30,4,1,29,Empirical research; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Interface (Java); Context (language use); Syntax (programming languages); Computer science; State (computer science); Language construct; Formal methods,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3450968 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tosem/tosem30.html#PaulweberSZ21 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3450968,,10.1145/3450968,3184084070,,0,000-987-649-080-323; 002-291-727-672-963; 002-967-883-694-133; 003-131-921-427-332; 004-296-789-760-892; 006-635-819-665-420; 007-381-832-300-53X; 010-852-259-152-365; 011-882-730-843-904; 016-446-377-960-149; 016-788-734-020-674; 018-369-083-778-030; 019-113-402-382-947; 021-155-668-810-504; 021-518-769-824-032; 021-785-921-993-647; 023-186-040-384-436; 023-525-094-334-358; 027-244-737-862-440; 028-157-911-232-198; 029-858-763-538-985; 030-219-725-823-27X; 032-534-780-514-907; 034-400-132-510-675; 034-542-802-471-470; 034-621-810-710-916; 036-805-318-187-317; 038-014-431-396-278; 046-216-399-297-450; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-129-010-190-280; 054-230-259-110-181; 055-042-610-674-194; 055-994-015-424-471; 057-648-310-683-602; 059-490-107-222-814; 059-975-823-275-808; 060-776-050-843-781; 062-147-321-839-065; 062-405-632-629-574; 062-961-043-503-946; 071-180-469-577-920; 073-682-597-789-568; 076-967-105-634-518; 077-754-909-759-890; 078-447-480-862-591; 082-714-949-563-192; 087-758-699-330-180; 099-346-724-924-680; 099-482-594-708-125; 100-162-484-718-18X; 100-712-624-370-474; 105-471-755-947-795; 106-113-148-648-052; 107-818-703-764-113; 113-305-012-062-482; 114-573-855-811-418; 134-048-117-134-427; 142-244-472-246-595; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-040-306-323-729; 151-202-864-876-079; 155-332-127-621-78X; 159-497-134-948-087; 167-303-943-230-544; 167-896-065-369-695; 168-932-299-108-131; 172-572-166-912-802; 181-401-889-710-788; 195-635-564-405-355; 196-789-941-898-801,4,false,,

The method allows one to start system development with a trustworthy high level system specification and to link such a ""ground model"" in a well documented and inspectable way through intermediate design steps to its implementation. The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich's Abstract State Machines. Through its versatility the ASM approach is non-monolithic and integratable at any development level into current design and analysis environments.

Many programming languages allow some non-determinism for evaluating expressions. The semantics only have in common that arguments are evaluated before an operator is applied. The evaluation of one argument may be interleaved with the evaluation of the other arguments. However, programming languages usually restrict this most liberal evaluation order. For example, the expression evaluation may take into account short-circuit evaluation of boolean expressions which implies that right operands must not be evaluated before the complete left operand is evaluated. Our approach provides a generic expression evaluation semantics that only need to be instantiated adequatly. We demonstrate this approach by the example of Ada95, C, C++, Java, C#, and Fortran.",,,391,406,Semantics; Short-circuit evaluation; Abstract state machines; Boolean expression; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Eager evaluation; Denotational semantics; Rule of inference; Computer science; Operand; Expression (mathematics); Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/21538136 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_23 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_23 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#ZimmermannD03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_23,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_23,1507424848,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 024-520-614-355-958; 034-728-900-389-951; 041-863-663-936-741; 059-553-350-068-285; 067-209-706-756-159; 083-972-922-498-894; 088-012-407-050-722; 105-620-622-527-144; 168-683-312-771-217; 176-077-001-502-714,13,false,,

It consists in generating test sequences from ASM models and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. This process is applied at different models, starting from the more abstract model to the one that is very close to the code.

Previous research, however, has focused on evolving Boolean functions directly, and not on general methods that are capable of generating the desired functions. The former approach has the advantage of being able to produce a large number of functions in a relatively short time, but it directly depends on the size of the search space. In this paper, we present a method to evolve algebraic constructions for generation of bent Boolean functions. To strengthen our approach, we define three types of constructions and give experimental results for them. Our results show that this approach is able to produce a large number of constructions, which could in turn enable the construction of many more Boolean functions with a larger number of variables.",,,781,788,Maximum satisfiability problem; Discrete mathematics; Boolean circuit; Boolean expression; Boolean function; And-inverter graph; Two-element Boolean algebra; Mathematics; Standard Boolean model; Theoretical computer science; Bent function,,,,"Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost",https://www.bib.irb.hr/829607 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/gecco/gecco2016.html#PicekJ16 https://core.ac.uk/display/80808611 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2908812.2908915 https://doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908915,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908915,,10.1145/2908812.2908915,2505008844,,0,000-304-245-350-205; 011-667-817-097-068; 021-490-149-588-591; 023-962-003-502-930; 024-613-563-583-629; 026-568-582-742-368; 030-946-701-941-192; 032-524-931-612-370; 033-027-137-279-186; 033-451-707-305-773; 037-788-453-907-297; 041-688-091-035-239; 043-867-033-033-696; 052-963-528-767-866; 054-767-714-008-550; 055-884-752-693-164; 062-387-209-729-694; 067-816-282-048-128; 082-586-013-456-492; 085-015-245-207-727; 089-087-838-476-20X; 117-567-852-717-926; 121-731-315-387-702; 122-310-071-776-058; 139-302-406-827-281; 141-907-254-896-256; 143-137-217-162-987; 146-169-054-540-618; 155-370-246-928-132; 170-212-971-613-168; 176-158-112-198-502; 188-651-125-784-29X; 189-070-156-692-866; 192-417-603-253-442,26,false,,

Through modern technologies these coalitions may form across company, organization and system borders. Therefor questions of access control and security are of vital significance for the architectures supporting these coalitions. ; In this paper, we present our first steps to reach a formal framework for modeling and verifying the design of privacy-sensitive dynamic coalition infrastructures and their processes. In order to do so we extend existing dynamic coalition modeling approaches with an access-control-concept, which manages access to information through policies. Furthermore we regard the processes underlying these coalitions and present first works in formalizing these processes. As a result of the present paper we illustrate the usefulness of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method for this task. We demonstrate a formal treatment of privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions by two example ASMs which model certain access control situations. A logical consideration of these ASMs can lead to a better understanding and a verification of the ASMs according to the aspired specification.",,,10,21,Risk analysis (engineering); Autonomous agent; Abstract state machines; Order (exchange); Task (project management); Access to information; Computer science; Access control,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6090,https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6090,,,2955621999,,0,,0,true,,unknown

Nondeterminism poses several challenges for the validation and verification activities, including the problem of inconclusive tests in model-based testing with model checker. It is a validation technique that uses model checker counterexamples as test cases. In this paper, we tackle the problem of testing nondeterministic systems by combining model-based testing and runtime conformance monitoring: the input sequences of the tests are automatically generated from nondeterministic models; then their execution is runtime monitored to check conformance of the code w.r.t. its specification. This technique provides an oracle for the test data, it never bears inconclusive responses, and it allows measuring the requirement coverage. The approach uses the Abstract State Machines as formal method for specification purposes and Java as implementation language. As a proof of concepts, the Tic-Tac-Toe game is taken as example of a system with nondeterministic behavior (both at specification and code levels).",,,178,187,Model checking; Formal specification; Test case; White-box testing; Model-based testing; Nondeterministic algorithm; Programming language; Runtime verification; Computer science; System testing,,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/29196 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icst/icstw2013.html#ArcainiGR13 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6571628/ https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/amost13.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icstw.2013.29,,10.1109/icstw.2013.29,1974416096,,0,006-244-045-917-365; 008-769-199-016-29X; 014-386-867-562-19X; 021-003-498-716-896; 029-914-316-585-134; 030-540-514-613-919; 032-479-599-783-61X; 034-099-892-995-61X; 043-199-494-018-359; 065-677-203-018-159; 066-428-876-787-656; 067-617-320-196-219; 075-766-744-118-563; 078-478-305-101-930; 086-566-018-626-814; 087-681-792-099-128; 094-734-717-644-755; 124-005-378-987-492; 128-477-864-220-706; 131-584-929-096-147; 134-468-842-444-533; 139-330-264-873-706; 155-508-868-821-427; 159-527-292-061-371; 164-782-145-340-185; 168-375-666-748-298; 170-042-235-963-558; 187-247-129-640-436; 189-521-689-083-502,18,true,,green

Salahuddin,"Finite state machine-derived specifications such as X-machines, extended finite state machines and abstract state machines, are an established means to model software behaviour. They allow for comprehensive testing of an implementation in terms of its intended behaviour. In practice however they are rarely generated and maintained during software development, hence their benefits can rarely be exploited. We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives.

Due to the high importance of interlocking table at the design state of a signalization system, the modelling and verification of interlocking tables are examined in this work. For this purpose, abstract state machines are used as a modelling tool. The developed models have been performed in a generalized structure such that the model control can be done automatically for the interlocking systems. In this study, NuSMV is used at the verification state. Also, the consistency of the developed models has been supervised through fault injection.

However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g., in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed. We illustrate how the control construct can improve the code's readability on some examples.

As yet, however, models of distributed computation are based on the idea that data is conceptually centralized. That is, they assume that data, even if it is distributed, is consistent. This assumption is not valid for many of the database systems in use today, where consistency is compromised to ensure availability and partition tolerance. Starting with an informal definition of eventual consistency, this paper explores several measures of inconsistency that quantify how far from consistency a system is. These measures capture key aspects of eventual consistency in terms of distributed abstract state machines. The definitions move from the traditional binary definition of consistency to more quantitative definitions, where the classical consistency is given by the highest possible level of consistency. Expressing eventual consistency in terms of abstract state machines allows models to be developed that capture distributed computation and highly available distributed data within a single framework.",,,249,265,Abstract state machines; Formality; Partition (database); Eventual consistency; Computer science; Computation; Binary number; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/handle/11250/2649755 https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/bitstream/11250/2649755/2/Prinz.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-30690-8_15 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30690-8_15 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sam/sam2019.html#SherrattP19 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30690-8_15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30690-8_15,,10.1007/978-3-030-30690-8_15,2971950760,,0,000-956-401-706-597; 011-052-400-879-696; 013-131-551-495-313; 017-198-523-833-487; 033-958-076-695-48X; 035-763-988-083-753; 040-032-715-523-620; 040-160-680-572-188; 051-036-287-939-589; 054-538-396-340-232; 055-064-873-133-709; 055-115-392-749-841; 059-804-639-548-953; 065-088-480-356-812; 071-095-858-265-422; 074-900-149-851-830; 081-502-913-250-396; 093-322-095-729-713; 111-567-034-049-446; 114-118-551-710-285; 121-535-204-910-494; 133-375-412-244-057; 139-330-264-873-706; 160-486-261-698-473; 167-158-277-963-931; 167-896-065-369-695; 182-898-069-406-257; 186-860-254-309-725; 189-088-980-311-035; 189-521-689-083-502,2,true,,green

A few others have been proposed to check consistency among software engineering models. For example, abstract state machines, knowledge-based approaches and so on. In this paper, we apply a different technique that uses critiquing systems. A critiquing system monitors user's actions and triggers a signal when one of those actions activates pre-specified rules, called critics. Because critics are small, we argue that they might be used to address two open issues in inconsistency detection, namely efficiency and scalability. An example of this approach is presented to check domain engineering models (feature diagrams) and application engineering models (class diagrams). Feature diagrams are used to abstractly and concisely express commonality and variability across a domain. These diagrams are used as source of information in the generation of critics in UML class diagrams.

Over the past years, there have been many approaches to implement concrete ASM-based modeling and specification languages. All of those approaches define their type systems and operator semantics differently in their internal representation, which leads to undesired or unexpected behavior during the modeling, the execution, and code generation of such ASM specifications. In this paper, we present CASM-IR, an Intermediate Representation (IR), designed to aid ASM-based language engineering which is based on a well-formed ASM-based specification format. Moreover, CASM-IR is conceptualized from the ground up to ease the formalization of ASM-based analysis and transformation passes. The feasibility of CASM-IR solving the uniform ASM representation problem is depicted. Based on our CASM-IR implementation, we were able to integrate a front-end of our statically inferred Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language.",,,39,54,Transformation (function); Code generation; Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Computer science; Representation (mathematics); Register machine; Formal methods,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91271-4_4 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91271-4_4 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2018.html#PaulweberPZ18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91271-4_4,,10.1007/978-3-319-91271-4_4,2802362387,,0,004-296-789-760-892; 004-897-988-924-005; 018-797-102-505-267; 020-013-882-140-265; 023-186-040-384-436; 027-587-253-875-266; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-014-431-396-278; 041-863-663-936-741; 060-733-812-776-088; 060-776-050-843-781; 062-961-043-503-946; 071-180-469-577-920; 073-682-597-789-568; 078-447-480-862-591; 082-714-949-563-192; 100-011-765-145-332; 122-512-813-599-624; 132-459-115-072-350; 135-539-376-572-715; 139-330-264-873-706; 150-651-154-106-309; 151-202-864-876-079; 175-828-452-951-250; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-635-564-405-355; 196-789-941-898-801,5,false,,

However, we remained intrigued by the fact that Blass and Gurevich used partial-order runs of distributed ASMs to explain runs of sequential recursive algorithms. We discovered that also the inverse simulation holds: for every distributed ASM with partial order runs, these runs can be described by runs of a sequential recursive algorithm.

F. Raihan; Mohammad Zulkernine,"Security, one of the most important aspects of software, gets very little attention during the software development life cycle (SDLC). Therefore, the software remains vulnerable to attacks which are handled by issuing patches or service packs by the software vendors. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to take security into consideration right from the very beginning of the software development process. However, most specification languages were not designed with an intention for specifying security requirements, and therefore, they lack some features to serve this purpose. As a result, we need suitable specification languages that can be used both for functional specification and security specification. We propose a formal extension of a popular specification language called AsmL (Abstract State Machine Language) for attack descriptions with a view to building secure software. We name the extended language AsmLSec. We present the details of AsmLSec syntax and semantics, describe how to model attacks using its constructs, and present the design and implementation of a compiler that generates attack signatures from the AsmLSec attack specifications. To evaluate the expressive power of AsmLSec, we model attack scenarios based on the benchmark DARPA data sets",,,775,782,Software requirements specification; Formal specification; Programming language; Specification language; Computer science; Software design; Software development; Functional specification; Software security assurance; Formal methods,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/IEEEares/ares2007.html#RaihanZ07 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4159874/ http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004159874 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4159874 https://doi.org/10.1109/ARES.2007.45 http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ARES.2007.45,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ares.2007.45,,10.1109/ares.2007.45,2150797223,,0,020-040-818-198-765; 049-484-005-083-012; 071-623-497-103-503; 071-754-420-083-591; 075-815-277-884-928; 092-535-009-672-590; 105-620-622-527-144; 128-142-405-176-908; 135-667-336-473-575; 153-852-808-629-003; 194-860-464-010-529,12,false,,

System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a semi-formal hazard analysis method that aims to identify safety requirements emerging from the analysis of potential interactions among components and inadequate control in the system’s design. In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a methodology capturing both the formal representation of ASM with the ability to generate safety properties from the STPA hazard analysis. This has the advantages of verifying the STPA requirements in a formal way, and giving insights for the improvement of the ASM specification, depending on these requirements. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to an insulin pump control system case study, showing what safety issues it highlights.",,,15,32,Software engineering; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Abstraction layer; Life-critical system; Control system; Hazard analysis; Temporal logic; Control (management); Computer science,Abstract State Machines; System Theoretic Process Analysis; Temporal Logic; Validation and Verification,,,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/abstract-state-machines-and-system-theoretic-process-analysis-for-safetycritical-systems(5457055e-69ef-4d65-90d5-36c40ef7c1b9).html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sbmf/sbmf2017.html#Al-ShareefiLD17 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_3 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3009511/ https://core.ac.uk/display/131169054 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-70848-5_3 https://core.ac.uk/download/131169054.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_3,,10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_3,2768006048,,0,012-145-702-064-547; 019-049-590-624-988; 021-346-180-894-785; 028-149-820-987-827; 029-430-162-022-193; 035-042-035-415-157; 038-467-272-421-692; 040-736-326-793-892; 043-656-153-786-617; 046-725-619-397-441; 046-838-597-306-588; 052-284-021-464-888; 053-879-779-234-065; 067-783-079-818-66X; 082-129-618-635-49X; 085-278-493-726-942; 099-943-874-354-121; 105-620-622-527-144; 113-750-969-333-096; 115-015-459-449-664; 121-369-334-638-387; 139-330-264-873-706; 175-725-863-324-84X; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,3,true,,green

Characteristic for knowledge-based systems are a complex knowledge base and an inference engine which uses this knowledge to solve a given problem. Specification languages for knowledge-based systems have to cover both aspects: they have to provide means to specify a complex and large amount of knowledge and they have to provide means to specify the dynamic reasoning behaviour of a knowledge-based system. This paper will focus on the second aspect, which is an issue considered to be unsolved. For this purpose, we have surveyed existing approaches in related areas of research.

Abstract state machines (ASMs) used to be called evolving algebras. The sequential ASM thesis and its extensions inspired diverse applications of ASMs. The early applications were driven, at least partially, by the desire to test the thesis. Different programming languages were the obvious challenges. (A programming language L can be viewed as an algorithm that runs a given L program on given data.) From there, applications of (not necessarily sequential) ASMs spread into many directions. So far, the accumulated experimental evidence seems to support the sequential thesis. There is also a speculative philosophical justification of the thesis. It was barely sketched in the literature, but it was discussed at much greater length in numerous lectures of mine. Here I attempt to write down some of those explanations.

109-847-160-864-681,Formal description and analysis of a distributed location service for mobile ad hoc networks,,2005,journal article,Theoretical Computer Science,03043975,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Uwe Glässer; Qian-Ping Gu,"In this paper, we define a distributed abstract state machine (DASM) model of the network or routing layer protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. In conjunction with the chosen routing strategy, we propose a distributed logical topology based location service (LTLS) protocol and give a formal description and analysis of this protocol on the DASM model. The high dynamics of mobile ad hoc networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks. A strategy for such networks is geographic routing in which each network node can find its physical location via GPS or other navigation technologies. To send a packet, the sender needs to know the most recent physical location of the destination node. This location information is provided by a location service protocol. The LTLS protocol has short message delivery delay, requires small routing tables, uses relatively few administrative packets, and has very good fault tolerance properties. Our goal in defining the network layer protocol in terms of a DASM model is twofold. First, we feel that the mathematical modeling paradigm of distributed abstract state machines provides an ideal formal basis for constructing, analyzing, and validating abstract requirements specifications of mobile ad hoc network protocols. Second, we intend to utilize the resulting behavior model as a formal basis for developing executable specifications serving as a platform for experimental validation of key system attributes and exploration of alternative design choices.",336,2,285,309,Routing protocol; Network layer; Logical topology; Distributed computing; Path vector protocol; Hazy Sighted Link State Routing Protocol; Network packet; Routing table; Zone Routing Protocol; Ad hoc wireless distribution service; Telecommunications network; Vehicular ad hoc network; Optimized Link State Routing Protocol; Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing; Computer network; Adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing; Computer science; Node (networking); Wireless Routing Protocol; Geographic routing; Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol; Link-state routing protocol; Mobile ad hoc network; Wireless ad hoc network; Dynamic Source Routing,Distributed abstract state machine; Wireless communication; Mobile ad hoc networks; Geographic routing; Location service; Logical topology,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81144215 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tcs/tcs336.html#GlasserG05 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397504007777,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.009,,10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.009,2051625963,,0,002-769-042-468-038; 006-555-745-475-703; 009-427-478-665-109; 012-219-543-790-259; 016-799-163-937-887; 019-603-467-121-002; 032-004-847-886-839; 033-956-133-731-573; 034-290-340-012-297; 038-478-246-901-944; 052-232-984-034-384; 052-800-009-711-389; 053-462-578-428-61X; 060-733-812-776-088; 086-911-802-907-518; 090-234-039-298-77X; 092-895-055-652-290; 105-620-622-527-144; 114-415-758-403-670; 122-361-626-940-924; 134-939-398-654-152; 143-553-610-880-814; 151-388-547-139-938; 154-916-490-571-433; 155-032-984-383-726; 157-311-554-599-521; 158-998-382-961-239; 163-157-595-088-394; 181-635-026-892-151; 189-521-689-083-502,23,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

We provide a complete embedding of PSL in the ASM language AsmL, which allows us to integrate PSL properties as a part of the design. For verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the code containing both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage of the AsmL language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both C# code and FSMs from AsmL models.

While the underlying platforms guarantee the correctness of smart-contract execution, they cannot ensure that the code of a contract is correct. Today, as evidenced by a number of recent security breaches, developers still have a hard time making contracts that work properly.Even though these incidents often exploit contract interaction, prior work on smart-contract verification, vulnerability discovery, and secure development typically considers only individual contracts in isolation. To address this gap, we introduce the <sc xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">VeriSolid</small> framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a abstract state machine based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify the behavior of a set of interacting contracts at a high level of abstraction. <sc xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">VeriSolid</small> allows the generation of Solidity code that is functionally and behaviorally equivalent to verified models, which enables the creation of correct-by-design smart contracts. We additionally introduce a graphical notation (called <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">deployment diagrams</i> ) for specifying possible interactions between contract types. Based on this notation, we present a framework for the automated verification, generation, and deployment of contracts that conform to a deployment diagram. To demonstrate the applicability of <sc xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">VeriSolid</small> , we translate existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) specifications to temporal properties for two of the most popular contract interfaces: ERC20 and ERC721.

Parallel abstract state machines (parallel ASMs) are such parallel algorithms, and the parallel ASM thesis asserts that every parallel algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to a parallel ASM. In an earlier article, we axiomatized parallel algorithms, proved the ASM thesis, and proved that every parallel ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a parallel algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual parallel models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that parallel ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new parallel components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what parallel algorithms ought to be. We prove the parallel thesis for the new, corrected notion of parallel algorithms, and we check that parallel ASMs satisfy the new axioms.",9,3,19,32,Random access; Cost efficiency; Parallel algorithm; Abstract state machines; Bulk synchronous parallel; Axiom; Turing machine; Computer science; Analysis of parallel algorithms; Theoretical computer science,Models of Computation-Unbounded-action devices; F.1.2 [COMPUTATION BY ABSTRACT DEVICES]: Modes of Computation-Alternation and nondeterminism  Parallelism and concurrency  Parallel programming; I.6.8 [SIMULATION AND MODELING]: Types of Simulation-Parallel Algorithms  Languages  Theory,,,Division of Mathematical Sciences,https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/Opera/157-2.pdf https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/157-2-abstract-state-machines-capture-parallel-algorithms-correction-and-extension/ http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/corr-final.pdf https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-2006-137.pdf https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/937555.937561 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tocl/tocl9.html#BlassG08a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1352582.1352587,,10.1145/1352582.1352587,2139801570,,0,034-400-132-510-675; 092-195-924-604-606; 111-567-034-049-446; 133-375-412-244-057,48,false,,

However, compared to the testing of functional requirements, these techniques are not prevalent that much in testing software security. This paper presents a model-based approach to automatic testing of attack scenarios. An attack testing framework is proposed to model attack scenarios and test the system with respect to the modeled attack scenarios. The techniques adopted in the framework are applicable in general to the systems, where the potential attack scenarios can be modeled in a formalism based on extended abstract state machines. The attack events, i.e., attack test vectors chosen from the attacks happening in real-world are converted to the test driver specific events ready to be tested against the attack signatures. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the most common attack scenarios.

116-384-169-584-825,A Framework for Testing Semantic Web Services Using Model Checking,,2009,conference proceedings article,2009 Fourth South-East European Workshop on Formal Methods,,IEEE,,Muhammad Shaban; Gill Dobbie; Jing Sun,"Web Services (WS), which are based on standard XML protocols, such as, WSDL, SOAP and UDDI, are the building blocks of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The aim of SOA is to automate web service tasks, such as, web service discovery, selection, composition and execution. Since XML is a syntax-based language, the automation of these tasks is still a challenge. To overcome this, web services can be described semantically using an ontology description language, e.g., Web Ontology Language (OWL), giving rise to semantic web services (SWS). Because semantic web services are relatively new, there has been little research into testing and quality assurance aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating test cases based on user requirements for testing semantic web services. In SWS frameworks, such as, Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO), the user requirements are presented as a goal specification in terms of a state model. We use a model checking approach to generate test cases from this state model.

The B representation of the goal specification is given as input to the model checker to generate concrete test cases using the assertion violation property of the model checker.

The technique allows us to transform a concurrent system with an unbounded number of agents into a finite-state abstraction. The systems to which the method can be applied are composed of many identical node processes that run in parallel with a controller process. Refinement checks on the abstract state machine can be performed automatically in the traces and stable failures models using the FDR model checker. We illustrate the method on an example based on a multiprocessor operating system.,250,1,171,186,Model checking; Abstract state machines; Abstraction model checking; Computer science; Multiprocessing; Abstraction (linguistics); Control theory; Theoretical computer science; Node (circuits); Process (computing),Counter abstraction; model checking; parameterised verification; CSP,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1571066109003375 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/entcs/entcs250.html#MazurL09 https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication2705-abstract.html http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/tomasz.mazur/publications/counterabstraction_AVoCS.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066109003375 https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/tomasz.mazur/publications/counterabstraction_AVoCS.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2009.08.012,,10.1016/j.entcs.2009.08.012,2153791853,,0,000-929-396-215-633; 013-251-302-334-929; 019-766-759-936-656; 020-634-962-470-186; 021-216-605-013-651; 026-553-603-265-467; 029-794-297-624-842; 032-715-858-137-586; 033-958-076-695-48X; 040-870-554-998-336; 047-079-855-238-98X; 048-172-117-656-568; 055-115-392-749-841; 105-923-138-582-449; 110-568-113-192-118; 114-127-015-968-535; 121-042-835-953-620; 159-450-590-630-808; 176-199-176-888-554; 196-353-928-571-647,8,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

The semantics of the simulator and the virtual visualization machine are formally defined by means of distributed Abstract State Machine (ASMs) rules. The ASM rules truly reflect the specification given in the SystemC User’s Manual and additionally provide a comprehensive definition of the virtual machine for advanced 3D animation. For the interaction between the SystemC simulator and the visualization we have defined a simple message exchange protocol, which can be used for socket communication.

The availability of high-level data types allow state elements to be represented both abstractly and faithfully at the same time. In this paper we look at symbolic analysis of ASMs. We consider ASMs over a fixed state background T that includes linear arithmetic, sets, tuples, and maps. For symbolic analysis, ASMs are translated into guarded update systems called model programs. We formulate the problem of bounded path exploration of model programs, or the problem of Bounded Model Program Checking (BMPC) as a satisfiability problem modulo T . Then we investigate the boundaries of decidable and undecidable cases for BMPC. In a general setting, BMPC is shown to be highly undecidable (Σ1-complete); and even when restricting to finite sets the problem remains re-hard (Σ1-hard). On the other hand, BMPC is shown to be decidable for a class of basic model programs that are common in practice. We use Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for solving BMPC; an instance of the BMPC problem is mapped to a formula, the formula is satisfiable modulo T if and only if the corresponding BMPC problem instance has a solution. The recent SMT advances allow us to directly analyze specifications using sets and maps with specialized decision procedures for expressive fragments of these theories. Our approach is extensible; background theories need in fact only be partially solved by the SMT solver; we use simulation of ASMs to support additional theories that are beyond the scope of available decision procedures.",3,,149,170,Model checking; Tuple; Decidability; Satisfiability modulo theories; Undecidable problem; Bounded function; Computer science; Symbolic data analysis; Boolean satisfiability problem; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SymbolicBoundedModelCheckingOfAbstractStateMachines.pdf http://www.ijsi.org/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=149&flag=1 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/Opera/199.pdf https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/symbolic-bounded-model-checking-of-abstract-state-machines-2/,http://www.ijsi.org/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=149&flag=1,,,2117336825,,0,002-438-766-985-114; 003-572-638-036-17X; 003-702-584-610-342; 004-322-783-807-772; 007-260-994-045-796; 011-067-617-302-064; 012-561-429-329-091; 013-321-617-545-692; 015-323-242-900-556; 015-537-856-335-698; 026-830-714-409-083; 029-858-763-538-985; 029-914-316-585-134; 030-528-452-467-247; 033-029-784-727-159; 040-475-935-409-54X; 040-870-554-998-336; 041-222-830-496-844; 045-765-754-055-719; 046-735-459-925-557; 050-578-715-624-648; 052-786-350-485-495; 057-052-364-771-627; 060-046-569-964-120; 071-763-443-479-85X; 076-267-222-460-45X; 077-445-945-450-939; 082-739-796-462-702; 089-355-190-014-421; 105-610-448-632-635; 106-669-165-984-633; 110-351-089-639-348; 114-280-445-045-344; 130-908-066-858-08X; 157-311-554-599-521; 164-490-126-283-133,15,false,,

In this paper we report on two results.; ; First, on the successful verification of the full case study using the KIV specification and verification system. We demonstrate that even though the hand-made proofs were elaborated to an enormous level of detail we still could find small errors in the underlying data refinement theory, as well as the formal proofs of the case study.; ; Second, the original Mondex case study verifies functional correctness assuming a suitable security protocol. We extend the case study here with a refinement to a suitable security protocol that uses symmetric cryptography to achieve the necessary properties of the security-relevant messages. The definition is based on a generic framework for defining such protocols based on abstract state machines (ASMs).

119-153-213-700-928,ICECCS - Two Formal Semantics of a Subset of the AADL,,2011,conference proceedings article,2011 16th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems,,IEEE,,Zhibin Yang; Kai Hu; Jean-Paul Bodeveix; Lei Pi; Dianfu Ma; Jean-Pierre Talpin,"The analysis and verification of an AADL model usually requires its transformation into the meta-model of this model-checker or that schedulability analysis tool. However, one challenging problem is to prove that the transformation into the target model of computation (MoC) preserves the semantics of the original AADL model or at least some of its properties. Moreover, the AADL standard lacks a formal semantics to make the validation of this translation possible. Albeit some of the related works give informal explanations on the model transformations they apply to interpret or compile AADL, the formal proof of semantics preservation remains in most cases altogether impossible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for a synchronous subset of AADL, which includes periodic threads and data port communications. Its operational semantics is formalized as a TTS (Timed Transition System). This formalization is one prerequisite to the formal proof of semantics preservation for our model transformation from AADL sources to our target verification formalism: TASM (Timed Abstract State Machine). In this paper, an abstract syntax of (our subset of) AADL is given, together with the abstract syntax of TASM. The translation is formalized by a family of semantics functions, which associates each AADL construct to a TASM fragment. Then, the proof of simulation equivalence between the TTSs of the AADL and the TASM models is formalized and mechanized using the proof assistant Coq.",,,344,349,Formal verification; Abstract syntax; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Operational semantics; Programming language; Proof assistant; Model transformation; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Formal proof,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iceccs/iceccs2011.html#YangHBPMT11 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5773408/ https://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/papers/iceccs11.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICECCS.2011.41 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5773408/ https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICECCS.2011.41 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005773408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iceccs.2011.41,,10.1109/iceccs.2011.41,2160479067,,0,009-457-671-845-715; 010-377-547-160-351; 014-495-099-070-581; 015-754-334-457-277; 023-147-244-284-961; 032-262-646-526-45X; 043-254-184-800-221; 043-684-320-465-000; 073-701-725-366-908; 074-293-491-869-778; 080-519-810-884-77X; 100-124-647-117-913; 109-533-517-419-694; 110-350-114-330-568; 111-730-611-795-21X; 113-088-227-467-286; 121-190-479-708-008; 131-308-023-807-482,11,false,,

Borghoff,"We introduce a framework that supports archivists in planning and running migrations. The central idea is that -once relevant information pieces of digital documents are modeled -desired migration results can be specified by means of preservation constraints. From these constraint specifications we are able to derive migration algorithms that provably respect a set of document properties before (pre-conditions) and after migration (post-conditions). Underlying is the concept of Abstract State Machines (ASM) modeling archival states. Migrations are modeled as sequences of basic operations that change the archive's state while respecting userdefined constraints. Among others, our target scenarios comprise legal and medical documents where considerable property changes cannot be tolerated and where constraint preservation must hold over a long period of time.",,,59,61,Abstract state machines; Set (abstract data type); Constraint (information theory); Medical documents; Relevant information; Long period; Computer science; State (computer science); Database; Theoretical computer science; Property (programming),Theory; Algorithms Digital archive; model; migration; preservation,,,,https://www.unibw.de/rz/dokumente/getFILE?fid=1415758 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1166160.1166179 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/doceng/doceng2006.html#TriebseesB06 https://doi.org/10.1145/1166160.1166179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1166160.1166179,,10.1145/1166160.1166179,1967332743,,0,059-667-666-030-262; 075-274-054-667-417; 078-734-192-200-974; 160-899-435-304-936; 174-136-741-396-077,3,false,,

XSLT is a standard way of performing structural rearrangement or presentational transformation of XML documents, but formulating complex queries is, compared to XQuery, difficult and error-prone. If XQuery expressions could be translated into XSLT (e.g. by a translator written in Java or XSLT itself), the benefits of XQuery would be immediately available to a wide range of commercial products. This paper introduces a process for translating queries formulated in XQuery syntax into XSL stylesheets. The process is described independently from a particular implementation by means of an ASM (Abstract State Machine). The ASM traverses the parse tree of a particular query and translates each node into corresponding XSLT commands. The result of this translation process is an XSL stylesheet that can be applied to an XML document in order to perform the given query. The presented ASM can be easily coded in Java or XSLT to implement a prototype XQ2XSL translator.",,,239,252,XSL; Processing Instruction; XSLT; XML database; Query language; Programming language; XQuery; Computer science; Streaming XML; XML; Style sheet,,,,,,,,,2583266483,,0,,3,false,,

In real-time systems, quantitative values of time, as reflected through the duration of actions, are central to the system's correctness. We review basic time concepts and explain how time is handled in different modeling languages. We expose the inherent paradox of incorporating quantitative time-dependent behavior in high-level models. High-level models are typically built before the system is implemented, which makes quantitative time metrics difficult to predict since these metrics depend heavily on implementation details. We provide some possible answers to this paradox and explain how the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language helps address some of these issues.",,,60,5,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Software system; Modeling language; Real-time operating system; Computer science; Correctness; Duration (project management),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icse/mise2007.html#OuimetL07 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MISE.2007.7 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:237148 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004273245,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/mise.2007.7,,10.1109/mise.2007.7,2155978473,,0,002-588-191-742-317; 012-279-185-443-189; 015-636-879-800-760; 019-911-894-187-65X; 021-919-166-899-366; 022-880-511-188-92X; 035-472-280-060-118; 038-467-272-421-692; 049-167-516-596-523; 063-878-383-053-020; 072-503-079-276-41X; 072-955-421-374-953; 094-201-067-598-571; 098-039-267-288-845; 107-818-703-764-113; 110-881-427-340-831; 115-015-459-449-664; 115-139-031-778-031; 129-703-488-579-457; 131-308-023-807-482; 167-800-651-749-165; 174-741-888-405-156,0,false,,

In our work, Behaviors of CGF are described in ASML, which is a kind of specification language of ASM. With this approach, the verification of the states of CGF behaviors can be possibly achieved at the design stage, and we can improve our behavior design then.

125-479-003-125-926,From AADL to Timed Abstract State Machines: A Verified Model Transformation,,2014,journal article,Journal of Systems and Software,01641212,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Zhibin Yang; Kai Hu; Dianfu Ma; Jean-Paul Bodeveix; Lei Pi; Jean-Pierre Talpin,"Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is an architecture description language standard for embedded real-time systems widely used in the avionics and aerospace industry to model safety-critical applications. To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (TTS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose). Finally, the verified transformation is mechanized in the theorem prover Coq.",93,,42,68,Formal specification; Architecture Analysis & Design Language; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Architecture description language; Programming language; Automated theorem proving; Model transformation; Computer science; Model-driven architecture; Semantics of logic,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121214000727 https://hal-univ-tlse3.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01095002v1 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01123837 https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/12950/ https://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/papers/jss14.pdf https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01123837/file/Yang_12950.pdf https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01095002 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jss/jss93.html#YangHMBPT14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121214000727 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058,,10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058,1998429448,,0,003-633-926-825-620; 005-283-314-519-468; 007-722-206-280-79X; 008-563-398-463-013; 009-457-671-845-715; 013-352-634-535-287; 014-433-375-269-260; 014-495-099-070-581; 015-754-334-457-277; 016-800-932-078-569; 018-793-561-283-562; 023-147-244-284-961; 025-897-991-209-485; 026-929-059-967-491; 032-262-646-526-45X; 032-476-271-556-356; 035-094-069-556-454; 035-518-394-425-446; 037-238-696-268-040; 038-139-157-695-265; 038-467-272-421-692; 039-853-548-305-791; 040-511-014-314-218; 043-160-022-814-818; 043-254-184-800-221; 043-684-320-465-000; 049-444-444-426-228; 052-957-621-282-424; 058-413-068-536-224; 059-903-469-081-37X; 060-733-812-776-088; 071-149-299-918-212; 072-659-327-044-492; 073-401-141-051-596; 073-701-725-366-908; 074-293-491-869-778; 075-317-537-213-441; 076-025-489-404-797; 078-912-916-949-104; 080-519-810-884-77X; 084-076-850-832-304; 098-519-421-099-085; 100-124-647-117-913; 100-681-356-295-56X; 103-979-961-534-144; 105-597-299-698-871; 106-449-039-568-159; 107-820-588-500-413; 107-890-932-297-180; 107-951-376-782-623; 109-533-517-419-694; 111-730-611-795-21X; 113-088-227-467-286; 114-723-268-888-518; 115-015-459-449-664; 116-296-327-783-257; 117-091-257-764-348; 120-878-624-757-199; 121-190-479-708-008; 122-845-661-963-17X; 123-441-945-469-160; 124-614-374-692-64X; 132-920-378-615-866; 133-813-232-822-224; 135-695-271-107-707; 140-294-050-741-177; 150-745-487-219-94X; 153-921-497-662-290; 168-484-158-939-306; 180-237-590-940-45X; 189-075-692-747-915; 191-133-493-945-948,50,true,,green

Essential new features are on the ASM-side naming, parameterizing, local states and possible return values of rules and were on the ALGOL60-side procedures, block concept and function procedures with return values. Turbo ASM–theory and ALGOL60 have two central phenomena in common: Operational style of specifying and semantics definition and named rules and procedures with their potential of recursion. There are quite a few connections between Turbo ASM and ALGOL60.

For this the notion of service mediator has been coined, which captures specifications of composed services with slots that have to be filled by actual services. Such mediators can be specified by expressions in Kleene algebras with tests (KATs) or equivalently by very restricted Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this paper we address the refinement of such specifications with the intention to capture more meaningful conditions on the service slots and to fine-tune the matching of the slots with actual services. In particular, we investigate refinements that express user preferences thus leading to personalised mediators.

In recent years the need for a formal understanding of the structures, the dynamic aspects and the processes of these coalitions has grown. In my ongoing thesis I propose a formal framework based on the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in order to grasp and characterize dynamic coalitions in general and privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions in particular. The ASM formalism allows for a structural description of dynamic coalitions as well as for a formalization of the inherent processes by means of ASM-runs, thereby enabling simulation, testing, and verification possibilities for the design of supporting architectures. This paper shows how the CoreASM-toolset is used to develop an abstract model of dynamic coalitions and extended to integrate trust-based access control mechanisms in order to enforce privacy aspects in highly dynamic coalitions. Finally an ongoing case study is introduced and first insights to the usability of the proposed model are given.",,,224,229,Formal verification; Software engineering; Distributed computing; Formalism (philosophy of mathematics); Abstract state machines; Usability; Trusted Computing; Computer science; Access control; Cloud computing,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6605793/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/compsac/compsac2013w.html#Sarrouh13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/compsacw.2013.30,,10.1109/compsacw.2013.30,2013356806,,0,000-050-287-885-315; 013-000-822-065-13X; 026-472-954-454-708; 036-259-458-043-168; 041-778-957-852-520; 095-382-838-815-581; 115-900-700-508-352; 139-330-264-873-706; 166-828-573-430-56X,3,false,,

The existing tool support for ASM was extended, in a previous work, to provide computer-aided verification, in particular by model checking. In this paper, we discuss the applicability of the model checking approach in general and describe the steps that are necessary to fit different kinds of ASM models for the model checking process. Along the example of the FLASH cache coherence protocol, we show how model checking can support development and debugging of ASM models. We show the necessary refinement for the message passing behaviour in the protocol and give examples for errors found by model checking the resulting model.

F. Raihan; Mohammad Zulkernine,"To protect software against malicious activities, organizations are required to monitor security breaches. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are those kinds of monitoring tools that have gained a considerable amount of popularity, A number of specification-based IDSs have been proposed, where security requirements or attack scenarios are specified using some languages. Currently, attack specification languages are being deployed for describing security requirements. Use of two different languages for software specification and security specification invites a number of unwanted but complicated issues, such as duplication of requirements specification effort as well as the existence of redundant and conflicting requirements. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection technique that uses a formal software specification language called abstract state machine language (AsmL) for the specification of security requirements. We present a framework, and develop the algorithm for the IDS that interprets the AsmL attack scenario specifications in order to detect intrusions. Moreover, we discuss case studies where the presented intrusion detection system is used to detect attacks.",1,,143,148,Software requirements specification; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Programming language specification; Specification language; Software; Intrusion detection system; Computer security; Computer science; Software design; Functional specification; Software security assurance; Formal methods; System requirements specification; Specification pattern,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/compsac/compsac2005-1.html#RaihanZ05 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1510011/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1510011/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/compsac.2005.69,,10.1109/compsac.2005.69,2109671077,,0,000-662-690-445-317; 049-484-005-083-012; 050-233-222-307-86X; 062-754-408-944-997; 167-294-237-365-546; 191-991-727-915-778; 194-589-331-287-190,15,false,,

The UML metamodel consists of informal description, class diagrams which are used to give the abstract syntax, and the well-formedness rules given in OCL. Furthermore, class diagrams have played an important role in software development because they provide basic information about a software system. In this paper, we propose a new method to support class diagrams based on Abstract State Machines. As an application of this method we will use a class diagram to represent OCL structure and therefore an OCL translator is generated. Based on the support of class diagrams and OCL, any user-defined UML model (M1-level), as an instantiation of the UML metamodel, can be compared against the UML metamodel. On the other hand, an object model (M0-level) can be checked based on the user-defined UML model (M1-level). Therefore, more errors can be reported to software developers during the early phase of software development.",,,100,105,Model checking; Abstract syntax; Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Software system; Programming language; Class diagram; Abstraction model checking; Computer science; Software development,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iastedSE/se2005.html#ShenL05,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iastedSE/se2005.html#ShenL05,,,28331999,,0,045-595-823-762-363; 082-714-949-563-192; 090-876-580-086-374; 096-005-773-435-141; 105-620-622-527-144; 109-552-559-143-618; 128-443-654-075-760,5,false,,

However, running the trusted OS and all the trusted applications in the same environment may cause problems---The exploitation of vulnerabilities on any component may affect the others in the system. Although ARM proposed the S-EL2 virtualization technology, which supports multiple isolated partitions in the secure world to alleviate this problem, there may still be security threats such as information leakage between partitions in the real-world partition manager. Current secure partition manager designs and implementations lack rigorous mathematical proofs to guarantee the security of isolated partitions. This study analyzes the multiple secure partitions architecture of ARM TrustZone in detail, proposes a refinement-based modeling and security analysis method for multiple secure partitions of TrustZone, and completes the modeling and formal verification of the secure partition manager in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. First, we build a multiple secure partitions model named RMTEE based on refinement: an abstract state machine is used to describe the system running process and security policy requirements, forming the abstract model. Then the abstract model is instantiated into the concrete model, in which the event specification is implemented following the FF-A specification. Second, to address the problem that the existing partition manager design cannot meet the goal of information flow security verification, we design a DAC-based inter-partition communication access control and apply it to the modeling and verification of RMTEE. Lastly, we prove the refinement between the concrete model and the abstract model, and the correctness and security of the event specification in the concrete model. The formalization and verification consist of 137 definitions and 201 lemmas (more than 11,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code). The results show that the model satisfies confidentiality and integrity, and can effectively defend against malicious attacks on partitions.

The attack scenarios or security requirements in some of these IDSs are specified in attack specification languages that are different from software specification languages. The use of two different languages for software specification and attack specification may generate redundant and conflicting requirements. The advantage of using the same language for both functional specifications and attacks specifications is that software designers can address the two different issues without learning two types of languages. We present a method of integrating Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) state charts that are extended finite state machine based software specification languages, with an open source IDS Snort. This work provides AsmL and UML users an IDS that they can use without knowing how to write Snort rules. We automatically translate attack scenarios written in AsmL and UML state charts into Snort rules with context information. The original Snort is modified so that it can use the rules automatically generated by the translator. Adding context information to Snort rules improves the detection capability of Snort. To show the efficacy of the presented approach, we have built a prototype and evaluated it using a number of well-known attack scenarios.",6,5,345,357,Software requirements specification; Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Finite-state machine; Extended finite-state machine; Attack; Programming language; Intrusion detection system; Computer science; Functional specification,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijisec/ijisec6.html#ZulkernineGK07 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-007-0023-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10207-007-0023-0,,10.1007/s10207-007-0023-0,1985317073,,0,010-879-691-706-072; 020-040-818-198-765; 033-820-436-580-458; 042-139-236-688-500; 048-452-075-747-424; 049-484-005-083-012; 061-700-590-321-189; 062-754-408-944-997; 069-134-219-719-640; 071-754-420-083-591; 075-815-277-884-928; 083-293-117-604-32X; 106-837-872-545-234; 109-932-529-571-755; 113-585-275-150-192; 118-811-919-346-268; 128-142-405-176-908; 135-667-336-473-575; 141-645-980-266-729; 148-232-227-837-375; 176-576-241-751-425; 194-589-331-287-190; 194-860-464-010-529,9,false,,

In particular, an instance of the ASM model has recently been introduced for computing queries to relational databases. This model, to which we refer as the BGS model, provides a powerful query language in which all computable queries can be expressed. In this paper, we show that when one is only interested in polynomial-time computations, BGS is strictly more powerful than both QL and whilenew, two well-known computationally complete query languages. We then show that when a language such as whilenew is extended with a duplicate elimination mechanism, polynomial-time simulations between the language and BGS become possible.",,,22,33,Abstract state machines; Query language; Programming language; Time complexity; Computer science; Computation; Relational database; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#BlassGB00 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/opera/139.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_3 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-44518-8_3 https://core.ac.uk/display/141961344,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_3,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_3,1793133712,,0,002-439-480-560-924; 015-421-225-402-052; 015-697-572-265-918; 018-789-381-636-015; 023-698-097-965-695; 045-410-456-418-275; 053-011-889-759-632; 068-257-256-309-994; 070-770-252-124-940; 096-701-121-721-360; 100-117-771-848-697; 107-561-736-253-087; 109-958-903-078-668; 115-181-157-045-414; 132-339-412-442-251; 139-765-984-878-516; 157-874-583-257-546; 168-196-175-947-627,8,false,,

As in the first article of the series, we are concerned here with ordinary, small-step, interactive algorithms. This means that the algorithms:(1) proceed in discrete, global steps,(2) perform only a bounded amount of work in each step,(3) use only such information from the environment as can be regarded as answers to queries, and(4) never complete a step until all queries from that step have been answered.After reviewing the previous article's formal description of such algorithms and the definition of behavioral equivalence, we define ordinary, interactive, small-step abstract state machines (ASMs). Except for very minor modifications, these are the machines commonly used in the ASM literature. We define their semantics in the framework of ordinary algorithms and show that they satisfy the postulates for these algorithms.This material lays the groundwork for the final article in the series, in which we shall prove the Abstract State Machine thesis for ordinary, intractive, small-step algorithms: All such algorithms are equivalent to ASMs.",8,3,363,419,Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Equivalence (formal languages); Formal description; Super-recursive algorithm; Bounded function; Computer science; Analysis of parallel algorithms; Randomized algorithms as zero-sum games,,,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tocl/tocl7.html#BlassG06 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ordinary-interactive-small-step-algorithms-ii/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tocl/tocl7.html#BlassG06 https://core.ac.uk/display/21079014 https://doi.org/10.1145/1243996.1243999 http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/oa1-rev.pdf https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1131313.1131320 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/171.pdf https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/opera/166.pdf,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ordinary-interactive-small-step-algorithms-ii/,,,2142611800,,0,002-438-766-985-114; 031-909-553-637-650; 034-400-132-510-675; 040-262-794-679-845; 068-257-256-309-994; 069-050-537-784-263; 086-148-945-111-115; 092-195-924-604-606; 127-265-490-736-503; 150-742-788-253-697; 151-522-501-802-495; 189-521-689-083-502,40,false,,

They consist of a large-number of sensors, processing centers and services deployed in a wide geographical area. Due to their complexity and heterogeneity, such systems face a high-level of uncertainty and the failure of one node can affect the availability of the whole solution. Monitoring services collect data about the state of components and elaborate a diagnosis, aiming to increase the reliability of the system. This paper proposes an Abstract State Machine model to capture the properties and behavior of monitoring services addressing system failures. The method encompasses the translation of the requirements of the system to ground models. We discuss the formal solution with respect to the problem domain and execute a simulation of the model. We discuss the suitability of the method for distributed systems and compare it with other modeling approaches.",,,483,490,,Formal Modeling; Abstract State Machines; Large-Scale Distributed Systems; Monitoring; Smart City,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0006303704830490,,10.5220/0006303704830490,,,0,,4,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

Unlike other logics for ASMs which are based on dynamic logic, our logic is based on an atomic predicate for function updates and on a definedness predicate for the termination of the evaluation of transition rules. We do not assume that the transition rules of ASMs are in normal form, for example, that they concern distinct cases. Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. We show that several axioms that have been proposed for reasoning about ASMs are derivable in our system. We provide also an extension of the logic with explicit step information which allows to eliminate modal operators in certain cases. The main technical result is that the logic is complete for hierarchical (non-recursive) ASMs. We show that, for hierarchical ASMs, the logic is a definitional extension of first-order predicate logic.",,,,,Computer science; State (computer science); Programming language,Abstract State Machines; dynamic logic; modal logic; logical foundations of specification languages.

Because of undecidability in the general case, one has to identify classes of ASMs and classes of properties in order to receive positive decidability results. One idea for this could be to put simple restrictions on the ASMs as forbidding certain advanced constructs. But it turns out that this does not help much. Additionally, the restrictions in those cases are very strong. Consequently, one has to look for others. Such restrictions may result from techniques which are intended to be used in the proofs of decidability. One proof technique is the reduction to a decidable reasoning problem in logic. In [8] and [10], this has been applied to receive some positive decidability results.; ; In this paper, we identify further classes of ASMs and classes of properties for which the general verification problem is decidable. Each proof is a reduction to the satisfiability problem of a fragment of linear temporal first-order logic which has respectively been proved to be decidable in [6] or [7].",,,341,355,First-order logic; Mathematical proof; Reduction (recursion theory); Discrete mathematics; Algebra; Abstract state machines; Decidability; Atomic formula; Temporal logic; Fragment (logic); Linear logic; Computer science; Computation; Linear temporal logic; Boolean satisfiability problem; Abstract machine,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#Nowack03 https://core.ac.uk/display/36491917 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20,1481826604,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 009-890-670-252-077; 013-134-288-375-43X; 025-803-420-641-004; 048-523-071-082-504; 052-995-531-322-274; 073-967-282-449-373; 079-932-533-401-672; 083-972-922-498-894; 086-223-977-202-166; 122-032-762-876-288; 157-108-282-805-526; 181-494-707-803-365,7,false,,

It is difficult to present the precise semantics which are taken as important in workflow system with the guide provided by OMG to the UML activity diagram.

In these models, two hierarchies exist: an organizational level hierarchy (describing systems' construction) and a functional level hierarchy (describing systems' functionality). Using a uniform hierarchical modeling language, system models at different hierarchical levels can be aligned in the context of the enterprise model. Using an operational semantics, each system model can be translated into executable code for model simulation and testing. The possibility to simulate and test models leads to the alignment verification for all system models across both hierarchies. In this paper we propose a method and tool for functional alignment verification. We use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) and the ASM language (AsmL) to formalize our graphical models for simulation and testing.

Besides processor simulation, the goal of our model is to provide a base for worst-case execution time estimation, providing abstraction capabilities that enable the scaling of analysis. The main difference between our model and other ASM extensions is that we define time as a mean to enable time accurate runs and hierarchical abstraction levels of components, while staying the closest possible to the original ASM mathematical foundation. The model is also designed to dynamically choose a suited component definition in order to adapt to information precision on data values. The time extension helps modelling non-instantaneous actions, which is essential for real-time systems. Adaptable precision and separation of the analysis from the model of the processor will prove well suited for integration into a worst-case execution time estimation tool.",6,4,343,363,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Formal language; Worst-case execution time; Extension (predicate logic); Context (language use); Computer science; Base (topology); Component (UML); Abstraction (linguistics),,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214973 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214973/document https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCCBS.2016.081810 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijccbs/ijccbs6.html#PaunMB16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijccbs.2016.081810,,10.1504/ijccbs.2016.081810,2580771748,,0,006-555-745-475-703; 020-555-541-620-312; 023-186-040-384-436; 038-812-259-656-192; 045-374-277-640-529; 072-659-327-044-492; 073-967-282-449-373; 075-656-639-837-964; 079-933-863-590-861; 091-647-015-058-757; 186-050-159-575-617; 189-521-689-083-502,0,true,,green

These software-based features demand software engineering approaches and formal methods that are able to guarantee correct operation, since malfunctions may cause harm/damage. Adaptive Exterior Light and the Speed Control Systems are examples of software-intensive systems that equip modern cars. We have used the Abstract State Machines to model the behaviour of both control systems. Each model has been developed through model refinement, following the incremental way in which functional requirements are given. We used the ASMETA tool-set to support the simulation of the abstract models, their validation against the informal requirements, and the verification of behavioural properties. In this paper, we discuss our modelling, validation and verification strategies, and the results (in terms of features addressed and not) of our activities. In particular, we provide insights on how we addressed the adaptive features (the adaptive high beam headlights and the adaptive cruise control) by explicitly modelling their software control loops according to the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) reference control model for self-adaptive systems.",12071,,302,317,Control engineering; Abstract state machines; Domain (software engineering); Control system; Automotive software; Software; Context (language use); Computer science; Functional requirement; Formal methods,,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/164542 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2020.html#ArcainiBGRS20 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_25 https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/806981 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_25,,10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_25,3027286998,,0,006-244-045-917-365; 019-113-402-382-947; 019-969-646-741-916; 038-812-259-656-192; 040-736-326-793-892; 046-052-720-561-652; 046-838-597-306-588; 056-856-322-909-445; 063-885-323-787-802; 074-005-404-726-279; 085-278-493-726-942; 092-195-924-604-606; 094-734-717-644-755; 099-943-874-354-121; 139-330-264-873-706; 167-036-940-702-338; 167-896-065-369-695; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,10,true,,bronze

Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while non-functional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language. We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis. We illustrate the applicability of our approach using a business process model (conference review process model) and a real-time system model (IP multicast routing case study).",20,2,181,211,Software requirements specification; Software engineering; Requirement; Requirements management; Non-functional requirement; Systems engineering; Non-functional testing; Computer science; Requirements analysis; Requirements engineering; System requirements specification,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00766-013-0200-9.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/re/re20.html#Hassine15 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0200-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0200-9,,10.1007/s00766-013-0200-9,1977896818,,0,000-656-717-877-89X; 002-379-345-853-212; 003-976-763-867-862; 004-401-593-036-028; 005-446-646-344-653; 006-039-407-120-941; 006-142-183-492-37X; 006-297-046-574-594; 010-476-306-580-316; 011-741-395-448-616; 012-866-683-360-083; 013-127-011-525-225; 013-323-465-006-209; 013-510-491-975-111; 013-928-235-960-154; 015-470-670-694-648; 016-247-452-352-046; 020-543-951-957-710; 021-393-248-577-201; 024-611-961-876-372; 027-454-455-407-20X; 029-179-141-014-285; 029-254-500-592-413; 029-829-517-529-597; 032-264-863-882-88X; 032-789-215-300-329; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-472-280-060-118; 035-529-830-797-566; 036-127-006-344-491; 036-534-837-469-912; 039-341-564-027-462; 040-600-942-984-198; 041-346-939-195-927; 043-492-897-038-250; 045-752-508-403-404; 047-150-157-414-017; 047-283-684-011-681; 049-146-361-579-514; 051-559-909-819-032; 052-662-994-155-999; 053-518-858-312-996; 055-053-195-247-403; 059-296-782-474-995; 059-668-171-537-840; 061-894-295-420-641; 061-985-253-791-843; 063-051-527-154-74X; 063-962-322-438-260; 068-833-537-683-192; 072-659-327-044-492; 080-868-561-376-664; 086-070-454-814-177; 087-394-566-172-292; 087-773-104-790-07X; 094-201-067-598-571; 096-542-907-513-410; 098-039-267-288-845; 101-157-509-991-693; 105-620-622-527-144; 113-740-395-634-754; 118-356-342-154-63X; 121-368-622-497-166; 125-207-608-823-277; 125-834-181-960-872; 139-330-264-873-706; 142-245-084-825-688; 145-783-472-489-02X; 147-019-981-692-623; 147-032-463-627-57X; 149-006-423-086-143; 158-818-737-324-028; 166-036-815-449-218; 179-343-098-581-065; 180-874-394-858-24X; 184-295-429-429-146; 189-521-689-083-502; 196-462-672-213-063,9,false,,

The role of a robust monitoring framework is to gather low-level data and assess the status of the components of the system. The framework collaborates with adapters for ensuring steady recovery plans and improving the availability of services. Monitors, as part of the system, are also affected by unavailability or random failures. In order to increase the reliability of the solution we verify the trustworthiness of the monitors and emphasize the need of redundancy. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying a monitoring solution for Large-Scale Distributed Systems. We formalize the behavior of the monitors with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model. The tool also supports the verification process by translating a simplified version of the model to an NuSMV specification, on top of which model checking can be applied. Properties of the model are expressed with the aid of computation tree logic.",,,153,167,Model checking; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Redundancy (engineering); Computation tree logic; Unavailability; High complexity; Computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74781-1_11 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74781-1_11 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74781-1_11 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sefm/sefm2017w.html#BugaN17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74781-1_11,,10.1007/978-3-319-74781-1_11,2786777509,,0,008-882-208-353-322; 022-174-461-059-506; 025-447-165-223-578; 040-736-326-793-892; 042-365-284-561-593; 046-564-660-076-40X; 047-754-867-502-510; 055-653-886-024-136; 058-550-246-937-217; 063-510-241-020-340; 066-288-975-518-599; 067-616-869-231-152; 067-935-311-381-272; 091-352-871-162-401; 099-943-874-354-121; 119-090-091-010-420; 136-630-420-315-104; 139-330-264-873-706; 146-349-056-917-771; 150-285-962-336-711; 166-251-841-262-352; 168-359-402-394-959; 189-521-689-083-502,2,false,,

Techniques to assure the quality of these applications are thus needed in order to identify in advance possible faults. Model-driven approaches to the testing of Web Applications can provide developers with a way of checking the conformance of the actual Web Application with respect to the model built from the requirements. These approaches can be used to automatically generate from the model a set of test cases satisfying certain coverage criteria, and thus can be integrated in a classical test driven development process. In this paper we present an automated technique for Web Application testing using a model-driven approach. We present a way of modeling Web Applications by Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and a process for generating automatically from the model a concrete test suite that is executed on the Web Application under test in order to check the conformance between the application and the model.",7703,,71,78,Software engineering; Web application; Distributed computing; Test case; Web modeling; Abstract state machines; Test suite; Unavailability; Computer science; Web testing; Test-driven development,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35623-0_7.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icwe/icwe2012w.html#BolisGGMM12 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/28172 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7,,10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7,166851811,,0,000-212-842-536-499; 004-165-410-572-804; 006-244-045-917-365; 007-111-583-746-548; 014-875-365-850-914; 018-408-105-437-771; 021-003-498-716-896; 024-774-638-733-220; 046-412-114-937-61X; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-299-736-589-511; 054-890-739-713-647; 082-093-993-781-083; 121-949-861-550-29X; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-436-309-880-519; 170-042-235-963-558; 189-521-689-083-502,11,true,,green

Based on a purified Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) variant, the authors present proposals for several important issues in BPM that have not been adequately considered in the BPMN 2.0 standard. It focusses on modality as well as actor and user interaction modelling and offers an enhanced communication concept. In order to render models executable, the semantics of the modelling language needs to be described rigorously enough to prevent deviating interpretations by different tools. For this reason, the semantics of the necessary concepts introduced in this book are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method. Finally, the authors show how the different parts of the model fit together using a simple example process, and introduce the enhanced Process Platform (eP2) architecture, which binds all the different components together. The resulting method is named Hagenberg Business Process Modelling (H-BPM) after the Austrian village where it was designed. The motivation for the development of the H-BPM method stems from several industrial projects in which business analysts and software developers struggled with redundancies and inconsistencies in system documentation due to missing integration. The book is aimed at researchers in business process management and industry 4.0 as well as advanced professionals in these areas.",,,,,Business rule; Artifact-centric business process model; Business Process Model and Notation; Process management; Business process modeling; Computer science; Process modeling; Business process management; Business process; Business process discovery,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2965040 http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-30496-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30496-0,,10.1007/978-3-319-30496-0,2494140567,,0,,11,false,,

Cooperation and competition are forms of interaction among concurrent activities and so they have to be coordinated. In order to achieve a good level of reusability and flexibility the coordination and the computation (how the component provides the service) need to be managed separately.; According to this principle we propose an innovative ap- proach based on two frameworks that are widespread in other domains such as the web services. We will show by means of a use case how we have implemented the component through the Service Component Architecture and how we have managed the coordination by means of the Abstract State Machine. In particular we will illustrate that is possible to change the coordination policy without modifying the implementation of the services provided by the component.",,,,,Distributed computing; Engineering; Reusability; Abstract state machines; Artificial intelligence; Systems engineering; Flexibility (engineering); Service Component Architecture; Robotics; Service (systems architecture); Component (UML); Robot,,,,,http://lucagherardi.it/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gherardi2011coordination.pdf https://cs.unibg.it/scandurra/material/conferma/pubblicazioni%20triennio%2030-12-2008_29-12-2011/conferenze/19.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/retrieve/handle/10446/25613/4745/icra2011_CoordinationCaseStudy.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/25613,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/25613,,,2268341001,,0,032-488-337-244-709; 130-757-359-503-252; 155-219-003-803-384; 169-155-683-413-328; 187-629-335-695-095; 189-521-689-083-502; 190-730-841-809-678,0,false,,

The method gener- alizes forward simulations from the refinement of I/O automata by allowing arbitrary m:n diagrams, and by combining it with the refinement of data structures. Abstract state machine (ASM) refinements have been used in many case studies based on Gurevich's (Gur95) definition, e.g. in (BR95) (BM96), (BS98), (BS00b). ASM refinements are usually verified using an informal notion of commuting diagrams to structure correctness proofs. Commuting diagrams are also used in approaches to the refinement of data structures (such as data refinement (dRE98)) as well as in simulation approaches for I/O automata (LV95), which focus on the refinement of control structure. Since refining one ASM by another may modify the data as well as the control structure, a generic proof technique for the verification of ASM refinements must necessarily combine the proof tech- niques used in both domains.",7,,952,979,Structure (category theory); Automaton; Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Data structure; Focus (optics); Correctness proofs; Computer science; Correctness; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://www.jucs.org/jucs_7_11/verification_of_asm_refinements/Schellhorn_G.pdf https://doi.org/10.3217/jucs-007-11-0952 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jucs/jucs7.html#Schellhorn01,https://doi.org/10.3217/jucs-007-11-0952,,,2146700742,,0,001-209-906-685-469; 004-410-486-404-600; 006-284-284-723-628; 006-558-580-892-106; 019-156-753-656-102; 035-881-215-850-292; 040-216-749-039-446; 052-358-079-746-887; 052-795-698-812-279; 053-079-247-067-977; 056-487-414-753-82X; 063-229-748-620-48X; 073-111-177-402-911; 102-173-153-935-055; 105-620-622-527-144; 109-076-897-820-269; 118-797-701-096-667; 126-650-758-092-281; 141-490-359-931-352; 156-704-488-337-056; 157-731-621-681-981; 158-754-379-827-820; 171-140-957-405-705; 176-197-240-615-472; 184-044-966-704-362; 195-635-564-405-355,68,true,cc-by-nd,gold

Benczúr; Uwe Glässer; Tamás Lukovszki,"We define here a distributed abstract state machine (DASM) [7] of the network or routing layer of mobile ad hoc networks [13]. Such networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks, since storing and updating large routing tables at mobile hosts would congest the network with administration packets very fast. In [1], the hypercubic location service is presented, which considers a very strong definition of fault-tolerance thereby improving state-of-the-art ad hoc routing protocols in several respects. Our goal in modeling the protocols for the distributed location service and the position based routing is twofold. First, we support the definition and validation of wireless communication protocols and implementations based thereon. Second, we feel that the abstract computation model naturally reflects the layering principle of communication architectures in combination with an uncompromisingly local view of the application domain. Thus we can identify fundamental semantic concepts, such as concurrency, reactivity and asynchronism, directly with the related concepts as imposed by the given application context.",,,204,217,Geocast; Distributed computing; Network packet; Routing table; Ad hoc wireless distribution service; Telecommunications network; Vehicular ad hoc network; Policy-based routing; Optimized Link State Routing Protocol; Static routing; Triangular routing; Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing; Computer network; Adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing; Computer science; Wireless Routing Protocol; Geographic routing; Wireless; Link-state routing protocol; Mobile ad hoc network; Wireless ad hoc network; Routing domain; Dynamic Source Routing,,,,,https://www.cs.sfu.ca/research/groups/NML/archive/pdf00004.pdf http://www.cs.sfu.ca/research/groups/NML/archive/pdf00004.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_11 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_11.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/48286111 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_11 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#BenczurGL03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_11,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_11,2129864673,,1,000-881-650-594-297; 002-704-891-527-779; 002-769-042-468-038; 006-555-745-475-703; 013-303-721-674-938; 032-004-847-886-839; 041-818-651-767-693; 052-232-984-034-384; 053-462-578-428-61X; 079-723-355-085-863; 086-911-802-907-518; 089-303-895-062-146; 090-234-039-298-77X; 092-895-055-652-290; 105-620-622-527-144; 111-472-453-337-520; 114-415-758-403-670; 151-388-547-139-938; 154-242-126-987-493; 154-916-490-571-433; 158-998-382-961-239; 162-008-052-602-531,9,true,,green

Among these concepts are parameterized (possibly recursive) sub-ASMs. Here we illustrate their power for incremental and modular system design by unfolding, via appropriate ASM components, the architecture of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), resulting from the language layering in combination with the functional decomposition of the JVM into loader, verifier, and interpreter. We survey the ASM models for Java and the JVM that appear in [34], together with the mathematical and experimental analysis they support.",,,20,35,Functional decomposition; Abstract state machines; Parameterized complexity; Programming language; Reuse; Structuring; Loader; Computer science; State (computer science); Java,,,,,,,,,3150645380,,0,,2,false,,

Vajihollahi,"Pattern and routine activities theories suggest that through a combination of decisions and innate understandings of environmental cues, likely offenders are able to separate good criminal opportunities from bad risks. The nature of this process is highly structured and allows researchers to anticipate likely concentrations for a variety of regular, daily activities, including criminal offences. This chapter sets out to model and test these theoretical principles. Mastermind represents an interdisciplinary research project in computational criminology jointly managed by ICURS and the Software Technology Lab at Simon Fraser University. Using the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in combination with a multiagent based modeling paradigm, we devise a formal framework for semantic modeling and systematic integration of the theories for crime analysis and understanding crime patterns. We focus on crime in urban areas and model spatial and temporal aspects of crime potentially involving multiple offenders and multiple targets. Mastermind is used in a hypothetical analysis of motor vehicle theft.Request access from your librarian to read this chapter's full text.",,,,,Formalism (music); Computer science; Crime analysis; Variety (cybernetics); Process (computing); Data science; Computer security; Criminology; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Art; Musical; Visual arts; Operating system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/9781599045917.ch013,,10.4018/9781599045917.ch013,,,0,,0,false,,

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable ""semantic units"" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by exploring methods for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study.

Due to the similarities of the underlying modeling concepts, a systematic integration of the two paradigms seems sensible, as each one has its particular focus and strength, complementing each other in several respects.

As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data used in OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. Typical OLAP queries are data intensive, and thus time consuming. In order to speed up the query computation, it is a common practice to materialize some of the computations as views based on a set of queries given. In general we wish to optimize query time under a given maintenance constraints. However, OLAP queries are not static and may change over time. Thus designing data warehouse is an ongoing task.

John Koo,"In many safety-critical applications of embedded systems, the system dynamics exhibits hybrid behaviors. To enable automatic analysis of these embedded systems, many analysis tools have been developed based on hybrid automata model. These tools are constructed by their own domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) but they are different in various aspects. To enable meaningful semantic interpretation of DSMLs, we propose an infrastructure for semantic anchoring that facilitates the transformational specification of DSML semantics. In the semantic anchoring infrastructure, the semantics of a DSML can be anchored to a well-defined semantic unit, which captures the operational semantics of hybrid automaton, via model transformation. The Abstract State Machine (ASM) is used as the underlying formal framework for the semantic unit. The semantics of a DSML is defined by specifying the transformation between the abstract syntax metamodel of the DSML and that of the semantic unit.

The MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) autonomic control loop is the most influential reference control model for self-adaptive systems. The design of complex distributed self-adaptive systems having decentralized adaptation control by multiple interacting MAPE components is among the major challenges. In particular, formal methods for designing and assuring the functional correctness of the decentralized adaptation logic are highly demanded.This article presents a framework for formal modeling and analyzing self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a formalism, called self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, that exploits the concept of multiagent Abstract State Machines to specify distributed and decentralized adaptation control in terms of MAPE-K control loops, also possible instances of MAPE patterns. We support validation and verification techniques for discovering unexpected interfering MAPE-K loops, and for assuring correctness of MAPE components interaction when performing adaptation.",11,4,25,35,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Software system; Exploit; Decentralised system; Self adaptive; Formal design; Computer science; Correctness; Formal methods,,,,Czech Science Foundation; EC within the H2020,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/80697 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/taas/taas11.html#ArcainiRS17 https://doi.org/10.1145/3019598 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3019598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3019598,,10.1145/3019598,2569664737,,0,002-303-791-871-874; 003-961-562-160-009; 009-478-555-234-848; 011-279-286-962-571; 015-431-392-895-236; 017-267-221-000-320; 021-363-677-036-393; 021-439-532-270-048; 021-757-961-886-223; 022-395-153-626-993; 024-280-364-036-902; 026-758-029-558-490; 029-360-947-468-979; 033-714-385-087-807; 033-900-257-525-98X; 036-209-156-334-749; 038-590-121-398-521; 040-301-971-526-778; 040-713-725-402-842; 040-736-326-793-892; 042-265-950-375-349; 042-724-412-903-511; 043-606-953-304-182; 044-518-217-352-641; 044-867-596-179-468; 046-838-597-306-588; 049-275-455-480-946; 056-367-549-228-583; 056-856-322-909-445; 058-550-246-937-217; 059-673-374-100-899; 061-183-924-693-44X; 063-510-241-020-340; 066-460-390-242-808; 067-344-047-169-381; 069-885-963-656-833; 071-669-167-146-571; 079-933-863-590-861; 080-973-329-836-237; 085-278-493-726-942; 089-383-738-356-354; 090-480-366-757-543; 092-564-774-138-910; 094-519-081-941-997; 094-673-035-950-337; 094-734-717-644-755; 100-075-502-499-318; 106-872-167-815-378; 116-598-122-121-683; 121-312-887-803-736; 124-321-318-074-709; 131-016-318-264-038; 131-836-227-316-887; 132-069-125-528-741; 139-330-264-873-706; 142-006-844-051-366; 148-286-190-701-960; 158-890-598-309-165; 159-972-611-997-704; 162-531-069-660-160; 168-359-402-394-959; 181-259-941-002-849; 181-401-889-710-788; 183-414-736-997-744; 189-521-689-083-502,65,false,,

All these languages focus on the distribution of computation, which is somewhat the same as concurrent computation. In addition, there is also the aspect of distribution of state, which is often neglected. Distribution of state is most commonly represented by communication between active agents. This paper argues that it is desirable to abstract from the communication and to consider abstract distributed state. This includes semantic handling of conflict resolution, e.g. in connection with data replication. The need for abstract distribution of state is discussed and a novel semantics for concurrency based on an abstract distributed state is presented. This semantics uses runs over so-called multistates, and hides the internal communication for replica handling. This way, distributed computation is described over an abstract memory model.",,,67,84,Distributed computing; Memory model; Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Semantics (computer science); Concurrency; Specification and Description Language; Computer science; State (computer science); Distributed memory,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01042-3_5 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01042-3_5 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sam/sam2018.html#Prinz18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01042-3_5,,10.1007/978-3-030-01042-3_5,2893244541,,0,013-131-551-495-313; 027-319-823-982-370; 033-958-076-695-48X; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-763-988-083-753; 040-160-680-572-188; 044-044-571-372-459; 050-949-219-922-70X; 055-115-392-749-841; 058-974-031-275-841; 063-737-289-030-595; 074-900-149-851-830; 093-322-095-729-713; 100-637-000-603-885; 105-620-622-527-144; 123-242-253-603-830; 125-392-303-019-904; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-019-981-692-623; 151-848-793-872-38X; 154-888-570-385-520; 160-486-261-698-473; 186-860-254-309-725,2,false,,

This is due to the fact that modeling languages currently used in these areas have informal definitions and ambiguous semantics, and therefore their use may be unreliable. Thanks to their mathematical foundation, formal methods can guarantee rigorous system design, leading to precise models where requirements can be validated and properties can be assured, already at the early stages of the system development. In this paper, we present a rigorous engineering process for distributed systems, based on the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formal method. We rely on the foundational notions of ASM ground model and model refinement to obtain a precise model for a client-server application for Cloud systems. This application has been proposed to tackle the problem of making Cloud services usable to different end-devices by adapting on-the-fly the content coming from the Cloud to the different devices contexts. The ASM-based modeling process is supported by a number of validation and verification activities that have been exploited on the component under development to guarantee consistency, correctness, and reliability properties.",28,4,567,595,Software engineering; Consistency (database systems); Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Programming language; Systems design; Computer science; Component (UML); Correctness; Formal methods; Cloud computing,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fac/fac28.html#ArcainiHR16 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00165-016-0371-5.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s00165-016-0371-5 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-016-0371-5 https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/457233 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00165-016-0371-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-016-0371-5,,10.1007/s00165-016-0371-5,2339731235,,0,001-985-584-854-347; 005-694-660-831-207; 006-244-045-917-365; 006-904-634-384-166; 007-111-583-746-548; 010-369-529-011-141; 013-062-615-622-259; 015-203-426-052-778; 021-999-130-505-452; 022-955-585-690-019; 024-774-638-733-220; 025-000-672-252-436; 025-447-165-223-578; 031-831-507-980-741; 032-354-281-297-321; 034-400-132-510-675; 039-562-045-588-902; 040-736-326-793-892; 041-863-663-936-741; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-626-828-795-238; 048-169-217-058-12X; 051-415-616-027-784; 053-375-408-597-968; 059-553-350-068-285; 062-831-921-502-520; 064-890-246-394-724; 065-305-981-336-690; 069-683-689-508-452; 070-103-009-419-950; 071-816-516-710-626; 072-884-492-292-431; 073-725-814-919-03X; 076-279-449-711-645; 078-154-283-914-947; 081-878-204-883-401; 082-129-618-635-49X; 084-896-669-567-810; 085-278-493-726-942; 089-177-439-212-556; 094-734-717-644-755; 097-740-692-545-856; 099-943-874-354-121; 105-768-234-371-847; 107-479-442-191-412; 110-588-490-917-987; 112-551-322-005-608; 113-330-233-645-723; 133-406-679-222-93X; 135-875-690-902-48X; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-019-981-692-623; 181-401-889-710-788; 186-076-165-513-653; 187-979-458-522-995; 188-287-205-700-57X; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-635-564-405-355; 196-464-841-214-921,18,false,,

Several transaction protocols have been suggested for the transaction management, but they are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity interrupts message exchanges among BPMSs which use different transaction protocols, so that the interoperability among the BPMSs cannot be guaranteed. To solve this problem, this paper suggests a semantics-based protocol for business process transactions. The suggested protocol is composed of the static semantics and the operational semantics. In the context of the static semantics, transaction states and messages are defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In the context of the operational semantics, stale transitions of business process transactions are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM). The suggested approach is expected to enhance interoperability among heterogeneous BPMSs, to increase the understandability for the transaction protocols, and to support automatic transaction execution and systematic transaction monitoring.",,,343,350,Software engineering; Operational semantics; Semantics (computer science); Interoperability; Semantic Web; Context (language use); Web service; Computer science; Transaction processing; Database transaction; Business process management; Business process,,,,,,,,,2800237729,,0,,0,false,,

Ait Mohamed,"Recent advancement in hardware design urged using a transaction based model as a new intermediate design level. Supporters for the transaction level modeling (TLM) trend claim its efficiency in terms of rapid prototyping and fast simulation in comparison to the classical RTL-based approach. Intuitively, from a verification point of view, faster simulation induces better coverage results. This is driven by two factors: coverage measurement and simulation guidance.

However, implementing auto-scaling mechanisms on cloud frameworks has generated many technical challenges. A typical challenge is that, these auto-scalers are often designed on different cloud systems making their evaluation, comparisons and wider applicability problematic. We propose an Abstract State Machine (ASM) model to address this problem. Our ASM model was developed systematically according to the behaviours of several auto-scalers, covering the necessary system processes. Our model was checked and validated with the CoreASM Model Checker. The validation and evaluation proves that our model can be used to analyse auto-scaling mechanisms, even without conducting real-life experiments.

Models typically allow an implementation freedom for a range of behavior. ASMs use two concepts to achieve this. Parallel composition abstracts from irrelevant sequentiality. Nondeterministic choice abstracts from irrelevant algorithmic detail. As a thought experiment, we wish to see the consequences of substituting parallel composition by nondeterministic composition. We have found that it provides some alternative benefits, e.g. the complex theory of partial updates wouldn’t be necessary, since successsive updates take care of combining the effect of partial updates. ASMs of different abstraction levels could be reused, since updates on different abstraction levels wouldn’t collide. It would be consistent with the current mechanism for exception handling in Microsoft’s ASM language. Finally, we also show that this change in semantics does not destroy the spirit of ASMs, in fact most ASM models wouldn’t need any change at all.

175-959-770-878-466,Demos/Posters/StudentResearch@MoDELS - Using fUML as Semantics Specification Language in Model Driven Engineering.,,2013,book,,,,,Tanja Mayerhofer,"In model-driven engineering (MDE), software is developed based on models which hence constitute the central artifacts in the software development process. Consequently, tools supporting MDE, such as model editors, interpreters, and debuggers are crucial in MDE. For developing such tools efficiently, modeling languages have to be defined formally. While for formally defining a modeling language’s syntax standard means exist, this is not the case for defining its semantics. This impedes the efficient development of tools which build upon the modeling language’s semantics, such as model interpreters, debuggers, and testing environments. To overcome this limitation, we present an approach for formally defining the semantics of modeling languages making use of the standardized and UML 2 compliant action language foundational UML (fUML). 1 Problem and Motivation Over the past years, the software development methodology model-driven engineering (MDE) gained significant popularity as it is a promising approach to address the growing complexity of the software systems that have to be built today [17]. In MDE, models are specified using modeling languages to define the structure and behavior of the software to be built. Model transformations and code generation are used to generate different kinds of software artifacts from these models, such as source code and deployment scripts. Because models constitute the central artifacts in MDE, its success depends significantly on the availability of adequate tool support for creating, exploring, analyzing, and utilizing models. In order to develop such tools1 in an efficient way, modeling languages (i.e., their syntax and semantics) have to be defined formally [1]. The abstract syntax of a modeling language defines the modeling language’s concepts and their relations. For formally defining the abstract syntax, metamodels are the standard means. MOF [13] constitutes a standardized, well established, and widely accepted metamodeling language for this purpose. Furthermore, MOF laid the ground for the emergence of a variety of tools building upon the abstract syntax definition of a modeling language, such as techniques for deriving modeling editors from a metamodel and generic components for model serialization, comparison, and transformation. The behavioral semantics of a modeling language defines the execution behavior of conforming models. A formal specification of the behavioral semantics is not only needed for precisely and unambiguously defining the behavior of models, but also to 1 In the remainder of this paper we will refer to tools for MDE, which are based on the definition of a modeling language, as model-based tools. establish the basis for an efficient development of model-based tools which build upon the behavioral semantics of a modeling language, such as model interpreters, debuggers, and testing environments [1]. Having the behavioral semantics of a modeling language explicitly and formally defined enables to automate the development of such tools. Unfortunately, no standard way for defining a modeling language’s behavioral semantics explicitly and formally has been established yet. Hence, formalizing the behavioral semantics of modeling languages remains a core challenge in MDE [1]. To address this challenge we propose to use the standardized and UML 2 compliant action language foundational UML (fUML) [15] as semantics specification language in MDE. 2 Background and Related Work The behavioral semantics of many modeling languages, including widely adopted languages such as UML [14], are only informally defined in natural language. This may lead to several problems, such as to ambiguities in the semantic meaning of the language’s modeling concepts. Furthermore, the behavior of models conforming to the modeling language cannot be formally analyzed and the models cannot be executed. Moreover, building tools, such as model debuggers and interpreters, is problematic if the language’s semantics is only defined in natural language. A commonly used approach to make models executable is to utilize code generators or to develop model interpreters with general-purpose programming languages (GPLs). However, in this approach the behavioral semantics is encoded in the manually constructed code generation templates or model interpreter implementations and hence is only defined implicitly. A problem that arises is that the behavior of models can again not be analyzed easily. Furthermore, the semantics can hardly be extended and reused which makes it costly to create and maintain. To overcome these limitations, adequate techniques for formally and explicitly specifying the behavioral semantics of modeling languages are needed. This need stimulated intensive research resulting in various approaches proposed in the past which can be divided into translational approaches and operational approaches. In translational approaches, models conforming to a modeling language are translated into models conforming to another language whose semantics is formally and explicitly defined. The advantage of this approach is that tools available for the target language can be used for the translated models. Its drawback, however, is that a translation from the source into the target language as well as a mapping of results obtained for the translated models to the original models have to be developed. Examples for translational approaches are the work of Chen et al. [2] and Di Ruscio et al. [4] using the Abstract State Machine formalism as target language, Rivera et al. [16] using Maude, Kuhne et al. [9] using Petri nets, and Rumpe et al. [7] using their System Model. In the operational approach, the behavioral semantics is directly introduced into the modeling language without moving to another language. This can be done by utilizing graph transformations as for instance proposed by Engels et al. [6]. Another way is to introduce operations into the metaclasses of a modeling language’s metamodel and provide their implementations using a dedicated action language. Several action languages and GPLs have been proposed for this purpose, such as Kermeta [12], Smalltalk [5], xCore [3], and EOL [8]. 3 Approach and Uniqueness Despite the fact that several approaches for formally and explicitly specifying the behavioral semantics of modeling languages exist, none of these approaches is widely adopted especially in industry. Moreover, the challenge of automatically generating model-based tools from semantics specifications is only addressed by few approaches which provide only partial solutions [1]. We advocate for operational semantics specification approaches because instead of translating models into a different language, the behavioral semantics is directly attached to the modeling language. We also believe that a standardized action language should be employed for this purpose. The action languages proposed until now are either GPLs (e.g., Smalltalk), proprietary languages (e.g., Kermeta), or adapted versions of standardized languages (e.g., xOCL integrated in xCore). In contrast, we propose to use fUML, a standardized and UML 2 compliant action language, for specifying the behavioral semantics of modeling languages. fUML defines the semantics of a subset of UML consisting of concepts for modeling classes and activities formally and provides a virtual machine (VM) for executing compliant models. As both MOF and fUML are standardized by OMG, fUML may be considered as promising candidate for becoming a standardized action language in metamodeling. To use fUML as semantics specification language and leverage the semantics specification of a modeling language to execute conforming models, the following challenges had to be addressed. First, fUML had to be integrated with existing metamodeling languages. Second, state-of-the-art metamodeling methodologies and environments had to be adequately extended to support a systematic and efficient development of behavioral semantics specifications based on fUML. Third, a generic model interpreter had to be developed to enable the execution of models based on the behavioral semantics specification of the modeling language they conform to. To enable the usage of fUML for specifying the behavioral semantics of modeling languages, we identified two strategies: a transformation-based and an integration-based strategy [11]. Because of the better integration with existing metamodeling environments, we decided to apply the integration-based strategy. In this approach, a metamodeling language is extended with the behavioral part of fUML in a way that enables to specify the behavior of the operations introduced for the metaclasses of a modeling language using fUML activities. By applying this approach we extended Ecore, which is integrated with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) [18] and which constitutes the most prominent implementation of MOF. Thereby we obtained a new metamodeling language which we called executable MOF (xMOF) that enables to specify a modeling language’s abstract syntax using the modeling concepts stemming from Ecore and its behavioral semantics using the modeling concepts stemming from fUML. Based on xMOF we elaborated a tool-supported methodology for developing the behavioral semantics of modeling languages (cf. Figure 1). The input for the semantics specification is the Ecore-based metamodel of a modeling language. As preparatory step we automatically generate a subclass for each metaclass defined in the metamodel. The language designer then adds operations and their implementations in the form of activities to these subclasses, which specify the behavior of the metaclasses. By subclassing the metaclasses for specifying their behavioral semantics, the behavioral semantics specification is clearly separated from the abstract syntax specification.

System states keep the runtime information relevant for the evaluation of OCL expressions. However, not all new language concepts of OCL 2.0 are already addressed in that formal semantics. We show how to overcome this by introducing new components to the object model and system states defining a dynamic semantics of OCL. In order to give precise rules that determine when the current system state has to be updated according to a change in the referred UML model, we make use of adequate mathematical means, namely Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Though our ASM specification also gives a clear definition for the evaluation of OCL constraints, it leaves sufficient flexibility for application specific implementations that have to determine when constraints are to be checked.",,,226,240,Formal specification; Semantics; Object Constraint Language; Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Formal semantics (linguistics); Finite-state machine; Parsing; Programming language; Object model; Implementation; Computer science; Object-oriented programming; Semantics of logic; Metamodeling; Abstract machine,,,,,http://adt.cs.upb.de/wolfgang/uml04.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30187-5_17 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30187-5_17 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30187-5_17 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-30187-5_17.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/uml/uml2004.html#FlakeM04 https://core.ac.uk/display/24389591,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30187-5_17,,10.1007/978-3-540-30187-5_17,2113339816,,0,003-222-418-546-848; 007-328-073-039-701; 015-684-306-905-705; 019-122-469-643-309; 027-150-301-897-047; 051-026-020-578-64X; 060-398-796-423-972; 063-503-736-414-805; 071-209-595-859-642; 086-413-838-544-040; 090-876-580-086-374; 109-272-379-753-850; 109-552-559-143-618; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-019-981-692-623; 153-707-875-643-103; 157-311-554-599-521; 161-343-908-907-538; 166-487-437-806-638; 167-345-480-076-717; 183-960-345-380-251; 189-521-689-083-502,11,false,,

In particular, an extension of the classical flowchart notation for control-state ASMs is proposed to support modularization and reuse in a direct way. The resulting ASM models are to be intended as ""ground models"" that can be used as basis or patterns to practically model and formally validate the behavior of typical robotic control tasks, and to link (via successive refinements) these high-level models of components to their implementation code by making their functional correctness mathematically controllable. The proposed flowchart extension and the availability of reusable and validated ground models allow a better system design and speed up the development of the system. Keywords-components; abstract state machines; ground mod- eling; robotic control tasks. I. INTRODUCTION Vision-based robotics is a challenging research field (1). One of the open and commonly stated problems in the field is the need for exchange of experiences, best practices, and high-level models of robust, reliable and flexible robot control applications with visual servoing functions. Recently, we investigated (2) the use of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method (3) for a systematic study and a rigorous foundation of modeling and validating Visual Servoing (VS) applications. The ASM method is a discipline for reliable system development, which allows to bridge the gap between informal requirements and executable code. The ASM formalism supports concurrency, heterogeneous state and modularity (compositional design and verification techniques). These features are essential to tailor ground models of control tasks definitions and associated syn- chronization/communication patterns of VS applications in rigorous, compositional and abstract terms. Ground models are blueprints of the to-be-implemented piece of ""real world"" that ""ground the design in the reality"" (4). In particular, we exploit the notion of control state ASMs (a class of ASMs (3)) as a natural extension of Finite State Machines. In this paper, we present an extension - called pattern- oriented control-state ASMs - of the classical flowchart notation for control-state ASMs to support modularization and reuse in a direct way. The proposed notation is useful to denote explicitly modeling elements to be further refined, to allow the definition/instantiation of recurring design so- lutions or patterns, to perform initial validation of separate high-level models and to improve model traceability between the flowchart diagrams and their concrete (textual) ASM specifications during the ground modeling and development process. In this context, the term ""pattern"" is to be intended to have its classical meaning, i.e., as a schema of a recurring solution, rather than the meaning of ""design pattern"" as in the book of the GoF (Gang of Four). We here repeat our previous experience in the embedded system-on-a-chip domain (5)(6) to shift the focus from implementation to design through high-level modeling. Our approach combines the expressive power and accuracy of control state ASMs with the intuition provided by visual flowchart descriptions to capture the behavioral view of task-level control of VS applications. As starting point, we manually extracted from the structure of existing (basically C/C++) code architectural descriptions (in terms of UML component diagrams) of high-level models of component control tasks and also recurring synchronization/communica- tion patterns between tasks that could be used for the ground modeling and analysis in ASM. We then defined these ASM abstract models using the pattern-oriented control-state ASM notation, transformed such models into executable ASM models using the notation ASMETA/AsmetaL (7)(8), and then validated them through basic formal analysis techniques (simulation and scenario-based simulation) (9). The resulting and validated ASM models are used as basis or patterns for high-level modeling and validating typical control tasks of VS applications in a formal way, thus leading from the abstract models to executable (C/C++) code by making their functional correctness mathematically controllable.",,,78,83,Abstract state machines; Executable; Finite-state machine; Programming language; Computer science; Notation; Component (UML); Correctness; Flowchart; Formal methods,,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/27497 https://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=icsea_2012_3_30_10302 https://www.thinkmind.org/download.php?articleid=icsea_2012_3_30_10302,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/27497,,,2198851761,,0,045-374-277-640-529; 046-838-597-306-588; 060-488-296-247-756; 070-224-959-381-109; 072-884-492-292-431; 092-993-910-172-087; 099-837-467-202-965; 099-984-761-532-498; 100-011-765-145-332; 144-615-563-005-837; 170-865-680-424-015; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

183-083-061-846-441,APCCM - Balancing redundancy and query costs in distributed data warehouses,,2005,conference proceedings,,,,,Klaus-Dieter Schewe; Jane Zhao,"Abstract State Machines (ASMs) encourage high-level system specifications without forcing the development into the ""formal methods straight-jacket"". This makes them an ideal formal method for applications in areas, where otherwise only semi-formal methods are used. One such area is the development of data warehouse and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) applications to which this article contributes. Based on an ASM ground model for data warehouses we show which problems have to be solved in the case of distribution. This mainly amounts to making decisions on materialised views. In this article we develop simple refinement rules for this purpose.

Abstract State Machines (ASMs) provide a mathematical framework for system modelling, while Model Checking is a technology for verification of system properties. Together, they form a powerful tool for checking systems. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a competitive model checking approach due to its ability to compactly encode BMC problems. In this paper, we present a method of applying ASP to BMC of ASMs. Given an ASM and a temporal property, we show how to efficiently translate the BMC problem for the ASM into a problem of answer set computation.

We define refinements following the semantical framework of observability, however, with respect to chosen pieces of the program. The time we consider is continuous as our motivation is related to systems of control that are usually specified within continuous time framework; the same framework is valid for discrete time. We remark that refinement of timed programs is not a simple replacement of a part of a program by making it more detailed. As an example to illustrate this we take Lamport's Bakery Algorithm with real-time constraints. However, one of the key questions related to the verification of refinements is the preservation of verification proofs for the non refined initial algorithm as much as possible when verifying the refinement. This is the case for the notion of refinement we define. We introduce a notion of asynchronous timed distributed algorithm, define its semantics and discuss in what logic can be expressed its functioning. Then we introduce notions of refinement, and consider a refinement of interprocess communication of real-time Lamport's Bakery algorithm using parallel message exchange. Such a refinement, contrary to our intuition, demands some non evident transformation of the initial algorithm to make it correct.",,,34,49,Mathematical proof; Distributed algorithm; Abstract state machines; Asynchronous communication; Programming language; Inter-process communication; Observability; Computer science; Lamport's bakery algorithm; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine; Refinement calculus,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#CohenS00 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4,1524432022,,0,002-806-387-188-795; 008-168-001-665-128; 018-689-712-347-616; 067-042-828-672-760; 073-967-282-449-373; 075-180-208-062-182; 164-825-489-208-505; 179-537-609-486-445,4,false,,

Both safety and liveness properties can be expressed in L MDG , however, only universal path quantification is possible. Fairness constraints can also be imposed. The property checking algorithms are based on implicit state enumeration of an ASM and implemented using Multiway Decision Graphs.",,,219,231,Model checking; Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Liveness; Temporal logic; Computer science; Computation; State (computer science); Theoretical computer science; Path (graph theory),,,,,,,,,2517620350,,0,,6,false,,
188-518-054-169-421,Exploring AADL verification tool through model transformation,,2015,journal article,Journal of Systems Architecture,13837621,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Kai Hu; Teng Zhang; Zhibin Yang; Wei-Tek Tsai,"Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is often used to model safety-critical real-time systems. Model transformation is widely used to extract a formal specification so that AADL models can be verified and analyzed by existing tools. Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) is a formalism not only able to specify behavior and communication but also timing and resource aspects of the system. To verify functional and nonfunctional properties of AADL models, this paper presents a methodology for translating AADL to TASM. Our main contribution is to formally define the translation rules from an adequate subset of AADL (including thread component, port communication, behavior annex and mode change) into TASM. Based on these rules, a tool called AADL2TASM is implemented using Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). Finally, a case study from an actual data processing unit of a satellite is provided to validate the transformation and illustrate the practicality of the approach.",61,3,141,156,Data processing system; Formal specification; Architecture Analysis & Design Language; Thread (computing); Abstract state machines; Embedded system; Programming language; ATLAS Transformation Language; Model transformation; Mode change; Computer science,,,,National Natural Science Foundations of China; State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment; Aviation Science Foundation of China,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.02.003 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762115000144 https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/exploring-aadl-verification-tool-through-model-transformation https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/15273/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01285662 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762115000144 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jsa/jsa61.html#HuZYT15 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01285662/document https://core.ac.uk/download/50531099.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.02.003,,10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.02.003,2036104167,,0,003-452-491-525-908; 004-556-315-552-977; 005-283-314-519-468; 007-390-658-965-687; 009-457-671-845-715; 009-579-092-837-214; 010-377-547-160-351; 012-376-264-978-899; 012-501-936-385-245; 013-273-929-914-959; 013-485-577-283-771; 014-495-099-070-581; 015-754-334-457-277; 018-454-820-506-796; 023-147-244-284-961; 024-959-580-012-041; 028-462-346-319-872; 041-646-351-416-885; 043-684-320-465-000; 043-956-404-991-194; 055-234-555-247-371; 057-733-059-712-448; 060-322-684-282-553; 060-733-812-776-088; 073-701-725-366-908; 081-893-094-163-328; 082-843-283-911-138; 087-706-291-213-250; 089-523-632-696-782; 094-201-067-598-571; 098-758-325-312-868; 100-124-647-117-913; 100-681-356-295-56X; 102-847-309-871-835; 103-342-475-836-747; 105-597-299-698-871; 107-890-932-297-180; 109-576-096-049-233; 110-350-114-330-568; 113-088-227-467-286; 119-153-213-700-928; 123-441-945-469-160; 125-479-003-125-926; 131-894-518-140-944; 135-695-271-107-707; 136-156-154-953-887; 142-600-520-460-720; 147-962-517-360-526; 149-928-216-874-711; 157-203-498-325-332; 167-800-651-749-165; 169-419-389-806-311; 180-237-590-940-45X,24,true,,green

We take the abstract state machine (ASM) as operation semantics for formalising communication model when using IaaS platform services, which can show the changes of dynamic performance about the platform status. Meanwhile, we simplify the model without sacrificing the service correctness from user's perspective.

Starting with a hypothesis about negative complexity in the environment of human persons today it describes a strategy, how to assist human persons to reduce this complexity by using a semiotic system. The basic ingredients of this strategy are a visual programming interface with an appropriate abstract state machine, which has to be realized by distributed virtual machines. The distributed virtual machines must be scalable, have to allow parallel processing, have to be fault tolerant, and should have the potential to work in real time. The objects, which have to be processed by these virtual machines, are logical models (LModels), which represent dynamic knowledge, including self learning systems.

There are ways to extend the abstract state machine (ASM) framework with distribution aspects, but there is no unifying framework for handling time so far.; ; We propose event structures extended with time as a natural framework for representing state machines and their true concurrency model at a semantic level and for discussing associated time models. Constraints on these timed event structures and their traces (runs) are then used for characterising different frameworks for timed computations. This characterisation of timed frameworks is independent of ASM and allows to compare time models of different modelling formalisms.; ; Finally, we propose some specific extensions of ASM for the expressions of time constraints in accordance with the event-based semantic framework and show the applicability of the obtained framework on an example with a standard time model and a set of consistency properties for timed computations.",,,217,232,Moore machine; Abstract state machines; State transition table; State diagram; Finite-state machine; Mealy machine; Extended finite-state machine; Concurrency; Computer science; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#GrafP05 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#GrafP05 http://www.univ-paris12.fr/lacl/dima/asm05/GrafPrinzASM2005-pgnb.pdf,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#GrafP05,,,1525455244,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 006-135-647-549-712; 006-555-745-475-703; 006-944-801-372-573; 008-168-001-665-128; 022-955-585-690-019; 025-514-448-365-880; 025-811-569-298-195; 027-765-297-864-912; 035-472-280-060-118; 037-445-945-364-220; 043-700-504-601-350; 055-936-391-993-277; 063-340-995-862-940; 064-740-359-461-707; 075-476-492-575-112; 105-620-622-527-144; 141-021-198-935-755; 189-521-689-083-502,2,false,,
