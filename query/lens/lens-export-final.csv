000-010-840-956-873,Rigorous Methods for Software Construction and Analysis - Using abstract state machines for the design of multi-level transaction schedulers,,2009,book,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,03029743; 16113349,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Germany,Markus Kirchberg; Klaus-Dieter Schewe; Jane Zhao,"Multi-level transactions have been suggested as an approach to increase transaction throughput in databases. The central idea is to enable some low-level conflicts to be ignored by taking higher-level application semantics into account. In this paper, we approach the formal specification of a multi-level transaction scheduler using Abstract State Machines. We are particularly interested in showing that concrete protocols for multi-level transaction processing arise as refinements of an abstract ground model specification. Furthermore, we are interested in the proof of desirable properties of such schedulers such as the correctness and if possible also completeness with respect to serialisability, and the recoverability of the accepted schedules. For this we investigate a two-phase locking and a hybrid protocol.",,,65,77,Transaction processing system; Formal specification; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Online transaction processing; Distributed transaction; Computer science; Correctness; Transaction processing; Database transaction,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/borger2009.html#KirchbergSZ09 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-11447-2_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5,,10.1007/978-3-642-11447-2_5,2170807566,,0,003-535-885-310-778; 006-675-327-793-692; 018-408-105-437-771; 022-955-585-690-019; 026-337-841-416-236; 039-762-238-191-318; 050-309-871-652-59X; 071-992-274-828-236; 078-075-549-814-324; 080-491-897-850-043; 082-391-519-387-578; 088-396-922-427-366; 094-914-877-452-152; 095-581-760-613-083; 097-847-188-441-943; 102-549-976-383-880; 104-030-181-011-305; 106-139-011-778-302; 133-684-460-780-726; 149-813-897-619-176; 185-668-391-346-964; 196-155-916-210-177,4,false,,

Semantically, ambiguities can cause a lot of problems during the lifespan of a business process. As Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are grounded to subject orientation, we have explored their capabilities with respect to representing and executing Subject-oriented BPM (S-BPM) models. Based on the ASM method we implemented an interpreter which allows not only the proof of the S-BPM concept in terms of semantical preciseness, but also the automated execution of S-BPM models in terms of a workflow engine. This workflow engine serves as a baseline and reference implementation for further language and processing developments, such as simulation tools, as it has been developed within the Open-S-BPM initiative.

SDL is a fairly complex, graphical formal description technique for the development of distributed systems, and has been broadly used in industry for many years. Efforts to define the semantics of SDL-2000 formally have started early in 1998. By now, a draft formal semantics is available, which is determined to become the official formal SDL semantics after its approval in 2000. It is based on the formalism of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which has been selected for several reasons including intelligibility and executability.; ; The formal semantics of SDL addresses the static semantics, transformation rules, and the dynamic semantics. The approach taken to define the dynamic semantics is particularly interesting. Although basically being operational, it differs from existing approaches in several ways. In this paper, we address and highlight some of these differences, using a simplified specification language called SSL instead of SDL. In defining a formal dynamic semantics for SSL, we formally describe an abstract machine, a compilation function mapping SSL specifications to code of this machine, and an operational definition of the set of initial states, using ASM as the underlying formalism. Furthermore, we present in some detail the semantics of SSL procedure calls.",,,242,265,Abstract syntax; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Action semantics; Operational semantics; Programming language; Computational semantics; Specification language; Denotational semantics; Specification and Description Language; Concrete syntax; Computer science; Failure semantics; Semantics of logic; Abstract machine; Well-founded semantics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-44518-8_14 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-44518-8_14.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#EschbachGGP00 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_14,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_14,1555618383,,0,000-427-107-788-225; 000-490-410-327-490; 003-338-696-404-449; 030-266-627-017-428; 036-243-510-363-569; 048-760-252-034-316; 055-995-372-610-402; 067-209-706-756-159; 083-972-922-498-894; 085-253-436-921-134; 088-012-407-050-722; 094-321-717-945-915; 105-620-622-527-144; 108-883-028-829-629; 112-323-824-635-381; 130-690-190-715-810; 131-207-717-577-017; 181-635-026-892-151,25,false,,

003-475-494-509-905,STAF Doctoral Symposium - Reasoning about Properties with Abstract State Machines,,2015,book,,,,,Gennaro Vessio,"Along the years, Abstract State Machines (ASMs) have been successfully applied for modeling critical and complex systems in a wide range of domains, and for analyzing their computationally interesting properties. However, unlike other well-known and established formalisms, such as Petri nets, they lack of a framework aimed at better supporting their applicability to the formal verification of systems. The goal of my PhD research is to reinforce the ASM formalism as a conceptual tool that developers can find useful and practical in order to analyze properties. 1 Research Objectives Several formalisms have been successfully applied to the development of critical and complex systems in a wide range of application domains, and to their ex-ante and ex-post analysis aimed at verifying and validating functionality and quality issues. Representing the system-under-study at a high level of abstraction allows developers to focus on algorithmic aspects, rather than on specific realizations of solutions at lower levels. Moreover, the mathematical foundation of formal methods provides complete and unambiguous investigations about the behavior and the properties the system-under-study is required to exhibit. In this context, researchers usually distinguish two orthogonal classifications of computationally interesting properties. On one hand, they distinguish between safety properties, which stipulate that “something bad” must never happen, and liveness properties, which state that “something good” must eventually happen, during computation [23]. On the other hand, they distinguish between domainindependent properties, which are interesting for broad classes of systems, and domain-specific, which strictly depends on the specific domain [12]. My PhD research is aimed at moving a first step towards the construction of a framework capable to capture computationally interesting properties within the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formalism [13].",,,1,10,Formal verification; Abstract state machines; Liveness; Rotation formalisms in three dimensions; Petri net; Computer science; Computation; Complex system; Formal methods; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1499/paper1.pdf https://ricerca.uniba.it/handle/11586/143505?mode=full.22,https://ricerca.uniba.it/handle/11586/143505?mode=full.22,,,2396288153,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 022-763-383-134-552; 022-969-892-721-038; 024-439-760-568-187; 024-750-012-894-552; 024-931-694-683-383; 033-203-060-633-211; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-530-929-944-578; 039-095-923-607-223; 041-257-163-032-383; 066-479-700-824-652; 075-511-016-975-837; 085-854-443-964-320; 087-897-547-671-699; 089-375-634-720-529; 092-195-924-604-606; 094-734-717-644-755; 099-345-665-612-630; 105-923-138-582-449; 107-820-588-500-413; 110-568-113-192-118; 113-595-336-847-284; 155-032-984-383-726; 189-521-689-083-502; 193-779-564-524-928,1,false,,

We show that turbo ASMs as defined in [7] allow one to faithfully reflect the common intuitive single-agent understanding of recursion. The argument is illustrated by turbo ASMs for Mergesort and Quicksort. Using turbo ASMs for returning function values allows one to seamlessly integrate functional description and programming techniques into the high-level 'abstract programming' by state transforming ASM rules.,,,218,228,Recursion; Algorithm; Kleene's recursion theorem; Bellman equation; Quicksort; Merge sort; Computer science; Functional programming; Function (mathematics); Object-oriented programming; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#BorgerB03 http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Methodology/RecursorASMs.pdf https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Methodology/RecursorASMs.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_12 https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_12 https://core.ac.uk/display/54887834 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_12,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_12,1591638745,,0,003-222-418-546-848; 004-410-486-404-600; 030-266-627-017-428; 034-400-132-510-675; 050-309-871-652-59X; 056-367-549-228-583; 060-733-812-776-088; 065-448-604-977-79X; 069-050-537-784-263; 073-111-177-402-911; 082-714-949-563-192; 084-663-601-596-132; 092-195-924-604-606; 100-638-520-723-965; 105-620-622-527-144; 146-979-983-810-015; 189-521-689-083-502,13,false,,

ASM is a well-defined (formal) method based on algebraic concepts. A distinct feature of ASM is its combination of parallel and sequential execution semantics. This makes it an excellent choice to formally specify and verify micro-architectures. We present a compilation scheme and an implementation of a runtime system supporting efficient execution of ASM.After introducing novel analysis techniques we present optimizations allowing us to eliminate many costly operations.Benchmark results show that our baseline compiler is 2-3 magnitudes faster than other ASM implementations. The optimizations further increase the performance of the compiled programs up to 264%.

The only objection raised to date has been that ASMs are iterative in their nature, whereas many algorithms are naturally recursive. There seems to be an inherent contradiction between the ASM idea of explicit and comprehensive states, and higher level recursion with its hiding of the stack. But consider recursion more closely. When an algorithm A calls an algorithm B, a clone of B is created and this clone becomes a slave of A. This raises the idea of treating recursion as an implicitly multi-agent computation. Slave agents come and go, and the master/slave hierarchy serves as the stack. Building upon this idea, we suggest a definition of recursive ASMs. The implicit use of distributed computing has an important side benefit: it leads naturally to concurrent recursion. In addition, we reduce recursive ASMs to distributed ASMs. If desired, one can view recursive notation as mere abbreviation.",3,4,233,246,Recursion; Stack (mathematics); Abstract state machines; Clone (algebra); Hierarchy; Computer science; Notation; Computation; Abstraction (linguistics); Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/119-recursive-abstract-state-machines/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/119.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jucs/jucs3.html#GurevichS97 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/opera/119.pdf,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/119-recursive-abstract-state-machines/,,,2586045098,,0,,23,true,cc-by-nd,gold
004-479-421-928-118,Modellierung - Modeling with Abstract State Machines: A support for accurate system design and analysis.,,2004,book,,,,,Egon Börger,"We survey applications of the Abstract State Machines (ASM) method for high-level system modeling and for well-documented refinements of abstract models to code. The outstanding feature of the ASM method is that within a single, precise yet simple, conceptual framework it naturally supports and uniformly links the major activities which occur during the typical software life cycle, namely: • requirements capture by constructing satisfactory ground models, i.e. accurate highlevel system blueprints, serving as precise contract and formulated in a language which is understood by all stakeholders (see [Bo03a]), • detailed design by stepwise refinement, bridging the gap between specification and code design by piecemeal, systematically documented detailing of abstract models down to executable code (see [Bo03b]), • validation of models by their simulation, based upon the notion of ASM run and supported by numerous tools to execute ASMs (ASM Workbench [De01], AsmGofer [Sc], C-based XASM [AK01], .NET-executable AsmL engine [Fo01]), • verification of model properties by proof techniques, also tool supported, e.g. by KIV [SA97] or PVS [Do98, GR00] or model checkers [Wi97, DW00, GTW03], • documentation for inspection, reuse and maintenance by providing, through the intermediate models and their analysis, explicit descriptions of the software structure and of the major design decisions. The key to the practicability of ASMs also under industrial constraints is to be found in the simple and intuitive way in which ASMs support defining most general Virtual Machines (VMs) and their refinements to lower levels of abstraction. ASMs naturally extend Finite State Machines by allowing a) states with arbitrarily complex or abstract data structures and b) runs with transitions where multiple components act either simultaneously (synchronous parallellism) or asynchronously (like globally asynchronous, locally synchronous Codesign-FSMs). The flexible ASM refinement notion provides a uniform conceptual framework for effectively relating different system views and aspects, in both design and analysis, filling a gap in the UML framework. The general yet frugal character of the ASM language, namely for a rigorous form of pseudo-code over abstract data, is the source for the flexibility in modeling and analysis which has been experienced in such different areas as: • industrial standardization projects: models for the ISO-Prolog standard [BD90], the ECMA standard for C# [BFGS04], the IEEE-VHDL93 standard [BGM94], the ITUT standard for SDL-2000 [GGP03], • programmming languages: definition and analysis of the semantics and the implementation for the major real-life programmming languages, e.g. SystemC [MRR03], Java and its implementation on the Java Virtual Machine [SSB01], domain-specific languages used at the Union Bank of Switzerland [KST98], etc. • architectural design: verification (e.g. of pipelining schemes [BM97] or of VHDLbased hardware design at Siemens [Sc02, Ch.2]), architecture and compiler coexploration [Te01, TWFT00], • reengineering and design of industrial control systems: software projects at Siemens related to railway [BBC96, BPS00] and mobile telephony network components [CP02], debugger specification at Microsoft [BBG00], • protocols: for authentication, cryptography, cache-coherence, routing-layers for distributed mobile ad hoc networks, group-membership etc., focussed on verification, • verification of compilation schemes and compiler back-ends [BR95, BD96, DGVZ98, SSB01], • modeling e-commerce [AVFY98] and web services [FGV04], • simulation and testing: fire detection system in coal mines [BCF96], simulation of railway scenarios at Siemens [BPS00], implementation of behavioral interface specifications on the .NET platform and conformence test of COM components at Microsoft [BS02], compiler testing [KKP03], test case generation [GR03].

As such, they can perform arbitrary actions on arbitrary objects. Abstract State Machines (ASMs) work on a similar basis. Exploring their capabilities with respect to representing and executing S-BPM models strengthens the theoretical foundations of S-BPM, and thus, validity of S-BPM tools. Moreover it enables coherent intertwining of business process modeling with executing of S-BPM representations. In this contribution we introduce the framework and roadmap tackling the exploration of the ASM approach in the context of S-BPM. We also report the major result, namely the implementation of an executable workflow engine with an Abstract State Machine interpreter based on an existing abstract interpreter model for S-BPM (applying the ASM refinement concept).

Moreover, we do this without sacrificing the completeness of the logic for statements about single steps of non-deterministic parallel ASMs, such as invariants of rules, consistency conditions for rules, or step-by-step equivalence of rules.",,,334,354,Consistency (database systems); Algebra; Abstract state machines; Equivalence (measure theory); Bounded function; Formalism (philosophy); Computer science; Completeness (logic); Computational logic; Formalism (philosophy of mathematics); Dynamic logic (modal logic); Equivalence (formal languages); Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170511097F/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11097 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11097 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11097.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30024-5_18,,10.1007/978-3-319-30024-5_18,2416924620; 3123603818,,0,009-629-063-776-099; 028-123-482-947-439; 050-995-433-771-903; 058-974-031-275-841; 060-835-792-407-425; 069-596-957-349-035; 092-195-924-604-606; 103-402-250-763-040; 105-847-270-652-393; 113-740-395-634-754; 139-330-264-873-706; 141-299-235-492-92X; 147-019-981-692-623; 163-251-542-247-372; 177-005-869-977-590; 187-241-344-225-588; 189-521-689-083-502; 194-217-962-751-132,4,true,,green

This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of these classes of algorithms. In Part I (Interactive Small-Step Algorithms I: Axiomatization), the axiomatization was extended to cover interactive small-step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary. This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment's replies but also the order in which the replies were received. In order to prove the thesis for algorithms of this generality, we extend here the definition of abstract state machines to incorporate explicit attention to the relative timing of replies and to the possible absence of replies.

We show that under our operational semantics, DES models correspond to a certain form of abstract state machines (ASMs) such that the Future Event List (FEL) is part of the transition system state and the transition function is based on event routines. Unlike other formalisms proposed for DES (such as Petri Nets or DEVS), our ASM semantics takes all basic DES concepts (like event types and the FEL) into consideration and allows for expressive transition system states representing the objects, properties, relations and functions of the evolving possible worlds of a simulation run. As a direct formal semantics of DES, it provides a basis for comparing, and explaining design choices in, different DES approaches.",,,762,773,Possible world; Abstract state machines; Discrete event simulation; Operational semantics; Programming language; Transition system; Petri net; Computer science; DEVS; Semantics of logic,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wsc/wsc2017.html#Wagner17a https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3242181.3242239 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8247830/,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wsc/wsc2017.html#Wagner17a,,,2783548027,,0,,2,false,,

Correct operation of a medical device depends upon the controlling software, whose development should adhere to certification standards. However, these standards provide general descriptions of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding particular methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper discusses how to integrate the use of a formal approach into the current normative for the medical software development. The rigorous process is based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method, its refinement principle, and model analysis approaches the method supports.

This process is cumbersome and costly. This paper reports preliminary results on an approach to further automate this process. The approach consists of combining automated test case generation based on systematically exploring the program's input domain, with runtime analysis, where execution traces are monitored and verified against temporal logic specifications, or analyzed using advanced algorithms for detecting concurrency errors such as data races and deadlocks. The approach suggests to generate specifications dynamically per input instance rather than statically once-and-for-all.

017-187-107-384-228,Towards a comprehensive extension of abstract state machines for aspect-oriented specification,,2016,journal article,Science of Computer Programming,01676423,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Marcel Dausend; Alexander Raschke,"Abstract With the paradigm of aspect-orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program's logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Those aspect-oriented specifications often can be more easily reused than extensions that are implemented directly into an existing specification. Another use case is the extension of a specification with new functionality or features. Although this would be possible with refinement too, with aspect-orientation it is not necessary to augment the original specification with “extension points” that can be used for refinement. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect-oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented according to an aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. The applicability of aspect-oriented specification in the context of ASM is demonstrated by means of examples, e.g. implementing a fading aspect into the light control system specification of a former ASM case study. Finally, the paper gives a brief overview about the developed tool that supports the writing of aspect-oriented ASMs.",131,,22,41,Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Specification language; Syntax (programming languages); Computer science; Aspect-oriented programming; System requirements specification; Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642316300168 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp131.html#DausendR16 https://oparu.uni-ulm.de/xmlui/handle/123456789/13647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2016.04.007,,10.1016/j.scico.2016.04.007,2346774892,,0,012-128-078-094-077; 016-518-569-550-70X; 026-476-847-126-74X; 041-517-722-797-71X; 043-387-003-850-22X; 046-323-920-158-771; 050-748-749-007-719; 057-092-273-178-939; 063-136-567-423-935; 066-438-289-080-25X; 083-406-778-129-800; 085-150-953-954-40X; 093-386-582-973-679; 109-226-156-590-33X; 118-317-992-753-595; 164-089-376-944-116; 189-019-422-819-118; 189-521-689-083-502; 193-996-632-030-972; 199-166-900-005-729,1,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

This paper first proposes a formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The formal description for main artifact of the standard (function block) is presented in the paper. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model checker which is used to formally verify properties of applications developed in IEC 61499 standard. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the formal verification of the IEC 61499 control systems. The paper also highlights the other uses of verification such as portability of IEC 61499 based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard.

The application of a rigorous process for their development reduces the risk of failures since validation and verification activities can be performed in a objective, reproducible, and documentable manner. In this paper we present an approach based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method. Starting from the model, validation and verification (V&V) techniques can be applied. Furthermore, by step-wise refinement, a final model can be obtained, which can be automatically translated to Open image in new window code. The process is applied to the smart pill box case study. Starting from the ASM model, we generate Open image in new window code for the Arduino platform after the application of V&V activities. Furthermore, we introduce regulation (IEC62304) and guidelines (FDA General Principles of Software Validation) that support the developer in medical software development.

However, many formal methods rely on a refinement-based development process which poses problems for their integration into agile processes. We consider redundancies within refinement hierarchies as a challenge for the practical application of stepwise refinement and propose superimposition-based modularization of refinement steps as a potential solution. While traditionally, each model in a refinement hierarchy must be developed and maintained separately, our concept allows developers to specify the refinement steps that transform a model into a refined one. We have developed tool support for the language AsmetaL and evaluated our approach by means of a case study. The results indicate a reduction of complexity for the development artifacts in terms of their overall size by 48.6% for the ground model and four refinements. Furthermore, the case study shows that superimposition-based refinement eases the development of alternative refinements for exploratory development and to cope with changing requirements. Thus, we consider this work as a step towards agile formal methods that are tailored to support iterative development, facilitating their incorporation into agile development processes.",,,19,35,Modularity; Software engineering; Agile software development; Iterative and incremental development; Abstract state machines; Computer science; Process (engineering); Formal methods; Agile Unified Process; Modular programming,Formal methods; Agile methods; Refinement; Modularity; Superimposition; Abstract state machines,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-68690-5_2 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icfem/icfem2017.html#BenduhnTSS17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2,,10.1007/978-3-319-68690-5_2,2763250045,,0,003-133-365-546-590; 004-658-725-907-299; 008-949-732-059-369; 010-093-344-106-481; 010-553-539-781-211; 014-658-440-497-962; 018-813-271-987-532; 019-018-332-749-866; 021-518-769-824-032; 022-642-232-517-811; 022-872-634-865-310; 022-955-585-690-019; 027-268-525-159-91X; 027-468-667-135-338; 027-940-163-523-026; 028-013-666-858-046; 028-792-689-630-701; 030-346-586-562-146; 030-920-587-764-616; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-079-624-756-003; 043-937-848-217-374; 048-174-621-765-826; 051-415-616-027-784; 055-152-904-810-195; 058-496-004-475-406; 062-561-989-848-248; 065-510-884-155-161; 067-678-153-508-682; 081-898-897-809-199; 087-129-866-492-100; 089-371-912-827-396; 089-996-407-346-946; 093-849-617-670-490; 094-370-227-985-915; 099-187-607-134-14X; 100-638-520-723-965; 109-460-512-355-404; 109-487-376-230-163; 120-587-910-077-450; 121-535-580-743-263; 123-082-630-503-713; 139-330-264-873-706; 145-070-700-492-395; 147-019-981-692-623; 154-550-982-498-232; 156-644-867-736-071; 164-463-044-157-818; 181-401-889-710-788,3,false,,

Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications. Almost all built-in behaviors are implicitly defined inside a concrete ASM language implementation and thus, the behavior is hidden from the language user. In this paper, we present a new ASM syntax extension based on traits, which allows the specifier (language user) to define new type abstractions in the form of structure and behavior definitions to reuse, maintain, structure, and extend the functionality in ASM specifications. We describe the proposed language construct by defining its syntax and semantics. The decision to use a trait-based syntax extension over other object-oriented language constructs like interfaces or mixins was motivated and driven by the results of previously conducted empirical studies. Moreover, we outline details about the implementation of the trait-based syntax extension in our Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language implementation.",,,237,243,Abstract state machines; Semantics (computer science); Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Construct (python library); Syntax (programming languages); Computer science; Language construct; Specifier; Formal methods,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2020.html#PaulweberPZ20 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-48077-6_17 https://eprints.cs.univie.ac.at/6397 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-48077-6_17.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17,,10.1007/978-3-030-48077-6_17,3028561472,,0,010-852-259-152-365; 011-283-753-736-189; 017-279-844-021-88X; 019-113-402-382-947; 027-587-253-875-266; 028-157-911-232-198; 029-858-763-538-985; 030-219-725-823-27X; 033-538-264-444-978; 034-542-802-471-470; 038-864-372-635-54X; 060-776-050-843-781; 074-291-812-104-639; 076-967-105-634-518; 082-714-949-563-192; 100-712-624-370-474; 106-113-148-648-052; 139-330-264-873-706; 150-651-154-106-309; 155-401-428-919-914; 167-303-943-230-544; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,2,true,,bronze

Chao,"In model-driven engineering (MDE), the unified modeling language (UML) 2.0 metamodel solution includes a metamodel that defines the language concepts and a user model that defines how the language concepts are represented. In UML 2.0, an important usage of metamodel is to ensure model consistency between different diagrams in the user model. However, most existing UML metamodels lack an integrated semantic framework to project each diagram in the user model as a view of the metamodel. To overcome the shortcomings of the current UML 2.0 metamodel approaches, we developed structure-behavior coalescence abstract state machine (SBC-ASM) for metamodel-based language (MBL), which provides an integrated semantic framework that is able to integrate structural constructs with behavioral constructs. Using SBC-ASM MBL as the metamodel solution of UML 2.0, each diagram in the user model can be projected as a view of the SBC-ASM.",15,3,4105,4115,Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Software system; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Computer science; Model-driven architecture; Data modeling; User modeling; Metamodeling,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sj/sj15.html#MaC21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2020.3027195,,10.1109/jsyst.2020.3027195,3198151314,,1,010-179-089-659-624; 010-259-460-265-065; 011-600-934-116-591; 018-310-241-038-972; 031-002-919-997-592; 036-130-582-494-612; 057-024-793-746-560; 068-069-218-370-251; 094-497-106-858-918; 118-651-741-885-650; 122-264-916-987-259; 139-443-501-950-439; 155-590-008-870-603; 197-433-208-487-70X,8,true,,bronze

There exist several techniques for test generation, which, however, may suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we assume that the system under test can be divided in several subsystems such that only one subsystem is active at the time. Moreover, each subsystem decides when and to which other subsystem to pass the control, by also initializing the initial state of the next subsystem in a desired way. We model these systems and we show how it is possible to generate tests in a very efficient way that exploits the division of the entire system in subsystems. Test generation for the whole system is performed by visiting each subsystem and generating tests for it. The tests are combined in order to obtain valid system traces. We show how several visiting policies influence the completeness of the test generation process. We propose a test generation approach for distributed systems with information passing.The generation is performed only considering the single subsystems.The tests for the single subsystems are combined to obtain system valid traces.The policy used to combine the tests influences the completeness of the approach.The approach, compared to techniques considering the whole system, is very efficient.",94,,93,108,System under test; Computer engineering; Initialization; Abstract state machines; Test (assessment); Completeness (statistics); Computer science; Scalability; State (computer science); Division (mathematics); Real-time computing,Test case generation; state explosion problem; information passing; abstraction; State Machines,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp94.html#ArcainiG14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167642314000483 https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/scp_asmtest2014.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/31125 http://www.imtlucca.it/news-events/events/job-market-seminars/file/2.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.007,,10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.007,2132941720,,0,006-244-045-917-365; 011-932-537-338-220; 021-003-498-716-896; 032-479-599-783-61X; 034-099-892-995-61X; 036-367-190-384-583; 040-736-326-793-892; 044-748-027-808-63X; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-299-736-589-511; 050-578-715-624-648; 054-890-739-713-647; 083-083-948-326-126; 088-034-630-494-534; 092-498-931-461-517; 107-735-608-364-425; 118-141-611-261-508; 146-579-344-003-185; 147-019-981-692-623; 155-304-026-125-99X; 170-042-235-963-558; 184-079-944-742-763; 189-521-689-083-502,8,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,green

Visualization is often considered a good means for people to communicate and to get a common understanding. We here make a proposal of a visual notation for Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and we introduce visual trees that visualize ASM transition rules. In addition to these graphical components that are based only on the syntactical structure of the model, we also present visual patterns that permit to visualize part of the behavior of the machine. A tool is also available to graphically represent ASM models using the proposed notation.",9946,,163,178,Abstract state machines; Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Control flow graph; Visual notation; Visualization; System requirements; Computer science; Notation,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/76960 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/staf/staf2016w.html#ArcainiBGR16 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12,,10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_12,2557286485,,0,004-523-713-863-964; 005-919-900-156-170; 009-458-823-413-271; 022-933-376-452-244; 023-768-709-930-989; 025-201-266-753-56X; 025-993-228-024-209; 033-970-130-900-328; 041-282-823-695-858; 046-838-597-306-588; 048-191-200-930-365; 048-671-564-463-836; 051-415-616-027-784; 078-769-584-552-581; 082-129-618-635-49X; 086-859-544-611-152; 099-279-646-831-077; 105-577-735-311-488; 109-631-113-107-984; 116-542-945-764-062; 125-305-031-194-056; 139-330-264-873-706; 139-976-718-596-858; 163-868-701-473-44X; 175-802-599-490-609; 177-110-190-578-440; 178-472-518-205-125; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,8,false,,

This paper proposes approach to formal modelling of IEC61499 function block execution semantics for popular model checking environment of SMV using Abstract State Machines. An operational semantics of IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model is presented using this framework. This paper first introduces the importance of model checking function block applications in different execution semantics. It highlights the uses of formal verification, such as, verifying portability behavior of component based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard.

This opens the door to the more faithful modelling of many scenarios where digital systems have to interact with the continuously varying physical world. Transitions in the extended framework are thus either moded (catering for discontinuously changing quantities), or pliant (catering for smoothly changing quantities). An operational semantics is provided, first for monolithic systems, and this is then extended to give a semantics for systems consisting of several distinct subsystems. This allows each subsystem to undergo its own subsystem-specific mode and pliant transitions. Refinement is elaborated in the extended context for both monolithic and composed systems.

The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most, general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich's Abstract State Machines.

Main purpose of FALKO is the construction and validation of timetables for railway systems. For simulation the whole closed-loop traffic control system is modelled within FALKO. The railway process model part of FALKO was formally specified using the ASM approach. C++ code is generated from the formal specification and compiled together with the handwritten C++ code of the other components to obtain the FALKO executable. The project started in May 1998 and was finished in March 1999. Since then FALKO is used by the Vienna Subway Operator for the validation of the whole subway operational service.,,,361,366,Operating system; Software engineering; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Executable; Service (systems architecture); Computer science; Component (UML); Software design; Abstract machine; Process (computing),,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#BorgerPS00 http://core.ac.uk/display/22190340 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_20,1498334749,,0,020-013-882-140-265; 100-011-765-145-332; 105-620-622-527-144; 191-925-997-526-005,40,false,,

The state of an Abstract State Machine has two components: a behavioural state and a data state. The behavioural states are shown on a state diagram, whose transitions are labelled with an “event” and a B operation. The firing of a transition is synonymous with the occurrence of its associated event. We use a synchronous model of communication based on shared events which simultaneously change the state of each participating machine. The B operation associated with a transition generally has the form G ⟹ S, where a necessary condition for the transition to fire is that G is true, and where S describes any resulting changes in the data state of the Abstract Machine. The paper includes simple examples, the translation of Abstract State Machines to B Action Systems, the translation of Abstract State Machines into “primitive” Abstract State Machines which have only behavioural state, the parallel combination of high level Abstract State Machines, and short notes on choice and refinement.",,,226,242,Formal specification; Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; State transition table; State diagram; Finite-state machine; Extended finite-state machine; UML state machine; Computer science; State (computer science); Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0053364.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2FBFb0053364 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/b/b1998.html#StoddartDGS98 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0053364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bfb0053364,,10.1007/bfb0053364,1838372604,,0,034-960-259-700-404; 036-339-321-338-061; 065-200-392-252-180; 108-925-457-506-038; 110-751-465-368-32X; 113-330-233-645-723; 117-821-177-762-731; 151-438-187-317-392,5,false,,

Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation. Furthermore this includes the automatic generation of the associated traceability data and test specification documentation. An initial framework has been defined to support exchangeabiUty of individual tasks in the generation toolchain. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by testing the complete heterogeneous signal communication of an exemplary avionics system, resp. platform instance, at system level as well as at software high-level.",,,1,8,Software engineering; White-box testing; Model-based testing; Keyword-driven testing; Test strategy; Artifact (software development); Computer science; Test data generation; System testing; Test Management Approach,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8080500/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/autest.2017.8080500,,10.1109/autest.2017.8080500,2765445829,,0,050-309-871-652-59X; 074-065-077-648-705; 106-620-223-312-062; 106-871-695-200-890; 118-933-923-879-716; 139-330-264-873-706,9,false,,

The construction of an ASM model for the basic S-BPM concepts revealed a strong relation between S-BPM and the ASM method for software design and analysis. In this paper we investigate this relation more closely. We use the analysis to evaluate S-BPM as an approach to business process modeling and to suggest some challenging practical extension of the S-BPM system.,,,52,72,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Systems engineering; Business process modeling; Relation (database); Subject (documents); Extension (predicate logic); Software product line; Computer science; Software design; Business process,,,,,https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Bpmn/SBpmVsAsm.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_6 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/s-bpm-one/s-bpm-one2012s.html#Borger12 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_6 http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Bpmn/SBpmVsAsm.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_6,,10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9_6,1592944918,,0,002-169-263-959-253; 002-276-425-419-510; 002-718-156-079-970; 003-222-418-546-848; 008-805-265-911-846; 010-999-872-320-79X; 018-408-105-437-771; 020-236-617-980-384; 020-579-587-866-103; 022-955-585-690-019; 027-765-297-864-912; 029-986-905-489-995; 030-266-627-017-428; 030-281-777-212-70X; 032-102-695-785-500; 032-840-983-437-425; 034-909-791-550-090; 035-763-988-083-753; 036-537-229-065-395; 036-760-675-825-974; 040-108-310-040-813; 040-216-749-039-446; 040-318-099-668-036; 041-863-663-936-741; 045-584-265-627-074; 047-171-023-451-405; 047-351-177-661-42X; 050-309-871-652-59X; 051-120-890-728-913; 051-207-280-802-006; 059-553-350-068-285; 060-733-812-776-088; 065-701-715-698-685; 068-095-360-218-444; 071-062-211-635-76X; 072-884-492-292-431; 073-816-232-715-647; 077-628-111-262-511; 078-710-812-112-46X; 079-041-047-051-540; 079-723-355-085-863; 080-491-897-850-043; 080-500-556-803-507; 081-328-440-016-426; 081-898-897-809-199; 083-187-716-670-274; 087-252-185-499-327; 089-821-955-035-108; 091-241-988-287-783; 095-581-760-613-083; 098-178-923-588-572; 100-638-520-723-965; 100-669-255-579-537; 101-704-045-813-337; 105-620-622-527-144; 107-077-171-963-473; 110-568-113-192-118; 113-330-233-645-723; 114-118-551-710-285; 117-821-177-762-731; 119-880-607-450-862; 120-344-022-077-245; 123-082-630-503-713; 125-560-067-036-63X; 128-514-103-399-449; 139-330-264-873-706; 145-506-276-588-893; 147-019-981-692-623; 154-000-910-997-626; 154-550-982-498-232; 157-311-554-599-521; 161-215-557-312-826; 176-197-240-615-472; 178-731-832-924-56X; 179-811-099-411-441; 181-720-098-319-123; 184-044-966-704-362; 189-521-689-083-502; 189-603-730-428-63X; 192-208-524-501-056; 193-959-926-710-145; 195-635-564-405-355,10,false,,

Two approaches are common: (a) Discrete models of time isomorphic to the natural numbers. Well established discrete formalisms can be used to describe the dynamical behavior of the system and time is uniform, but sequential refinement and composition of systems designed for different time scales are dificult, and continuous changes can not be well represented. (b) Hybrid models as sequences of intervals of the real numbers. Discrete events happen where such an interval ends (and, typically, the next one starts) and are assumed to take no time. Continuous changes take place during intervals. Point intervals are used to model consecutive discrete steps without an interveningcon tinuous phase. Hybrid models can express the combination of continuous and discrete changes and allow sequential refinement of discrete steps. There are no problems for composition of systems because of differing bases of time. But this model of time is dense and non-uniform, and this makes reasoningm ore dificult.",,,423,424,Algorithm; Distributed computing; Operational semantics; Rotation formalisms in three dimensions; Interval (mathematics); Natural number; Composition (combinatorics); Point (geometry); Discrete event dynamic system; Computer science; Real number,,,,,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_34 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_34 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#Rust03 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_34,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_34,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_34,1795366490,,0,,4,false,,

However, at the same time, it is also a classic BPM domain concerned with typical aspects like creation and exchange of diagrammatic process models, elicitation of domain knowledge, and implementing process (models) into organisations and IT systems. Nevertheless, the Abstract State Machine (ASM) concept, a formal and abstract specification means for algorithms, has been and is fundamental and an important cornerstone for the S-BPM community. The first formal specifications for S-BPM has been developed by Egon Borger using ASM means—namely a specification for an interpreter engine for the subject-oriented modeling language PASS, the Parallel Activity Specification Schema. However, for the sake of intuitive and comprehensive use, ASM can be enriched with defining the passive aspects of PASS, namely the (data) structure of process models and data object appearing in the processes. Here it is useful to complement ASM description means with concepts that are better suited for that tasks. This work analyzes how the S-BPM research community has combined ASM with the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to generate a precise, while comprehensible, system specification for the execution of formal, subject-oriented process models. Furthermore, it will be argued why this combination is worthwhile overcoming the weaknesses of both generic and technology independent specification approaches.",,,283,300,Formal specification; World Wide Web; Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Specification language; Computer science; Ontology language; Business process management; System requirements specification; Business process,,,,,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000135023 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/birthday/boerger2021.html#ElstermannWFSB21 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16 http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16,,10.1007/978-3-030-76020-5_16,3167363613,,0,006-928-937-292-054; 007-443-653-464-302; 010-341-905-776-857; 026-476-847-126-74X; 051-207-280-802-006; 069-630-781-497-603; 075-382-664-940-343; 090-813-859-969-15X; 104-225-610-168-168; 107-632-494-069-898; 110-568-113-192-118; 132-920-378-615-866; 139-330-264-873-706; 151-522-501-802-495; 159-101-499-902-15X; 164-485-336-163-635; 189-521-689-083-502; 196-652-929-785-727; 197-358-066-658-712,7,false,,

The extensions lead to a typed version of ASMs and a more specific notion of strong data refinement, which incorporates the preservation of information content by means of schema dominance. Each typed ASM can be effectively translated into an equivalent ordinary one. Providing typed ASMs helps to exploit the existing logical formalisms used in data-intensive applications to define a ground model.

Stärk,We extend the logic for abstract state machines by a read predicate that allows to make precise statements about the accesses of locations of an ASM. The logic can be used to prove security properties of ASMs like that the machine does not read locations containing critical information or that all accesses of the machine to the abstract memory are permitted. The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs. The logic is complete for hierarchical ASMs and still sound for turbo ASMs. It is integrated in the ASMKeY theorem prover.,336,2,343,365,First-order logic; Predicate (mathematical logic); Abstract state machines; Programming language; Automated theorem proving; Predicate (grammar); Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,Abstract state machines; Logic; Access predicate; Secure information flow; Sequentialization of parallel ASMs,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tcs/tcs336.html#NanchenS05 https://core.ac.uk/display/82685251 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397504007790 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82685251.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011,,10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.011,1965433750,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 008-638-531-729-145; 016-347-557-587-544; 028-123-482-947-439; 028-506-345-827-164; 033-685-119-299-460; 034-400-132-510-675; 047-716-841-284-351; 050-035-003-144-688; 063-233-629-815-382; 075-867-333-727-447; 078-466-392-576-046; 088-447-800-261-940; 122-149-423-286-67X; 135-363-344-034-158; 189-521-689-083-502,2,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

In particular, we focus on multi-agent ASMs extended with the seq construct for turbo ASMs. We explain why traditional data flow analysis can not simply be applied to ASMs: data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph whereas in this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program’s flow graph. We revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis taking into account the specific, parallel nature of ASMs, and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. In particular, we analyze the role played by different types of terms in ASMs and deal with the problem of terms that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, terms that are shared between several agents, and derived terms. We also discuss what consequences the use of the turbo ASM construct seq has on our analysis and revise the approach accordingly. Finally, we specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria for this class of ASMs and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.",23,1,21,41,Model checking; Data mining; Test case; Abstract state machines; Model-based testing; Control flow graph; Context (language use); Computer science; Data flow diagram; Data-flow analysis,Model-based testing; Data-flow analysis; Abstract State Machines,,,,https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication7718-abstract.html https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00165-009-0134-7 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fac/fac23.html#Cavarra11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7,,10.1007/s00165-009-0134-7,2063949613,,0,000-062-386-336-352; 006-244-045-917-365; 008-505-985-768-799; 014-001-838-392-291; 017-616-691-581-222; 019-727-238-517-403; 020-013-882-140-265; 020-619-446-070-850; 020-922-982-616-644; 021-003-498-716-896; 023-330-932-628-428; 025-234-726-320-353; 036-096-259-695-637; 041-863-663-936-741; 044-748-027-808-63X; 050-309-871-652-59X; 050-468-192-551-533; 060-028-923-434-466; 060-046-569-964-120; 060-776-050-843-781; 073-111-177-402-911; 081-175-355-114-182; 087-804-745-188-678; 090-391-538-360-098; 090-876-580-086-374; 099-774-459-576-718; 100-693-903-913-08X; 105-620-622-527-144; 115-565-554-416-015; 128-269-677-177-769; 139-330-264-873-706; 157-311-554-599-521; 166-958-854-495-162; 171-904-473-379-026; 187-172-669-687-960; 189-521-689-083-502; 194-694-563-937-513; 195-635-564-405-355,4,true,,green

Song; Sofiène Tahar; Z. Zhou,"The presence of uninterpreted symbols in the logic means that we must distinguish between a state machine M and its abstract description D in the logic. A given abstract description D will determine a machine M for every interpretation ¢. For the purpose of hardware verification we are interested only in finite state machines (FSMs). However, an abstract description will represent infinite as well as finite state machines, since abstract sorts admit infinite interpretations. We call Abstract State Machine a state machine given by an abstract description in terms of MDGs, or equivalently DFs, as explained below. 2.3.1 Represen t ing sets using MDGs . Let P be an MDG of type U--+V. Then, for a given interpretation ¢, P can be used to represent the set of vectors SetCy(P) = {¢ e ~¢y J ¢ , ¢ ~ (~U)P}. In the next section, MDGs will thus be used in this fashion to represent sets of states and sets of output vectors. We shall also see how MDGs can be used to represent relations. 2.3.2 Describing s t a t e m a c h i n e s with MDGs . An abstract description of a state machine M is a tuple D = (X, Y, Z, FI, FT, Fo), where X, Y, Z are disjoint sets of variables, viz. the input, state, and output variables respectively. Let r/be a one-to-one function that maps each variable y to a distinct variable r/(y ) obtained, for example, by adorning y with a prime. The variables in Y~ = ~/(Y) are used as the next-state variables. X, Y and Z must be disjoint from Yq Given an interpretation ¢, an input vector of the state machine M represented by D is a C-compatible assignment to the set of input variables 94 E. Cerny, F. Corella, M. Langevin, X. Song, S. Tahar, and Z. Zhou X; thus the set of input vectors, or input alphabet, is (I)¢x . Similarly, ¢¢z is the output alphabet. A state is a C-compatible assignment to the set of state variables Y; hence the state space is ~¢y. A state ¢ can also be described by an assignment Ct = ¢o~-1 E ~¢, to the next state variables. Fx is an MDG representing the set of initial states, of type U-+ Y, where U is a set of abstract variables disjoint from X U Y U Y~ U Z. Typically, FI is a one-path MDG where each internal node N is labeled by a variable y E Y, and the edge that issues from N is labeled by the symbolic initial value of y, which can be an individual constant, an abstract generic constant, or an abstract variable u E U. It is possible to specify that two data registers have the same value, but that this common value is arbitrary, by using the same u as symbolic initial value of the abstract state variables representing the two registers. Given an interpretation ¢, a state ¢ E ibCy is an initial state iff ¢, ¢ (3U)F~. Thus the set of initial states of the state machine M represented b y D is s1 = {¢ e I¢, ¢ # (3U)Ft} = Set (Fx). FT is an MDG of type (XUY)-~ Y' representing the transition relation. Given an interpretation ¢, an input vector ¢ E q?Vx and a state ¢~ E ~0, a state ¢,t E ~¢y is a possible next state iff ¢, ¢ U ¢' U ¢"" o ~?-I ~ FT. Thus the transition relation of the state machine M represented by D is RT = {(¢, ¢', ¢"") E ffPCx v ~¢ × d,¢ (¢,, r . l ¢ , ¢ u ¢ ' u o y l ) # FT}. FO is an MDG of type (XUY)-+ Z representing the output relation. Given an interpretation ¢, the output relation of the state machine M represented by D is Ro = {(¢, ¢', ¢"") E @Cx X@CyX@Cz I ¢ , ¢ U ¢' U¢"" [= To}. To recapitulate, for every interpretation ~ of the sorts, constants and function symbols of the logic, the abstract description D = ( X, Y, Z, FI , FT , Fo ) represents the state machine M = (~2x,dPy,¢ ¢ dPCz, SI, RT, Ro) with input alphabet @:~, state space @¢y, output alphabet @¢ z, set of initial states $I, transition relation RT, and output relation Ro. 2.3.3 S ta t e explora t ion . Given an abstract state machine description D = (X, Y, Z, FI, FT, Fo) we can compute the set of reachable states of a state machine M ¢ ¢ ¢ = (~x, ~Y, ~z , $I, RT, Ro) represented by D, for any ¢, using the MDG algorithms mentioned above, while at the same time checking that a given condition on the outputs of the machine, the invariant, holds in all the reachable states. The invariant is represented by an MDG C of type W -+ Z, where W is a set of abstract variables disjoint from X, Y, Y', Z and U. (Recall that Fx is of type V -4 Y.) For a given ¢, an output vector is deemed to satisfy the invariant iff ¢, ¢ ~ (3W)C; thus SetCz(C) is the set of output vectors that satisfy the invariant. Verification with Abstract State Machines Using MDGs 95 The procedure, called ReAn for Reachability Analysis, is the result of lifting the algorithm given in [CoBM89b] to the realm of abstract types and MDGs. It can be described by the following pseudo-code: I. ReAn(D, C) 2. R := Fx; Q := Fx; K := 0; 3. loop 4. K := K + 1; 5. I := Fresh(X, K); 6. 0 := ReIP({I,Q, Fo},X U Y,0); 7. P := PbyS(O, C); 8. if P ~ F then return failure; 9. Y := ReRP({L Q, FT}, Z U Y, n); 10. Q := PbyS(g,R); 11. if Q = F then return success; 12. R := PbyS(R, Q); 13. R := Disj(R, Q); 14. end loop; 15. end ReAn; In this pseudo-code, I, N, P, Q and R are program variables that take as values MDGs representing sets of states, and O takes as values MDGs representing sets of output vectors. We will identify the program variables and their values in the following explanations when there is no risk of confusion. Before each loop iteration, R represents the set of reachable states found so far, while Q represents the frontier set, i.e., a subset of SetCy(R) containing at least all those states that entered Setey(R) for the first time in the previous iteration. In line 5, Fresh(X, K) constructs a one-path MDG representing a conjunction of equations x = u, one for each abstract input variable x E X, where u is a fresh variable from the set of auxiliary abstract variables U. The value of the loop counter K is used to generate the fresh variables. This one-path MDG is assigned to I, which represents the set of input vectors. In line 6, the relational product operation is used to compute the MDG representing the set of output vectors produced by the states in the frontier set. The resulting MDG is assigned to O. Then, in line 7, the pruning-bysubsumption operation is used to remove from O paths representing output vectors that satisfy the invariant C. The resulting MDG is assigned to P. In line 8, if P is not F, then the procedure stops and reports failure. We have implemented a counterexample facility that can then be invoked to produce a most general symbolic trace leading to a state for which the outputs do not satisfy the invariant. Examples of such a trace can be found in [ZSTC96]. If P is F, then SetCz(O) C SetCz(C), i.e. every output vector produced by a state in the frontier set satisfies the invariant, and the verification procedure continues. 96 E. Cerny, F. Corella, M. Langevin, X. Song, S. Tahar, and Z. Zhou In line 9, the relational product operation is used again, this time to compute the MDG representing the set of states that can be reached in one state from the frontier set. Note that the MDG Q representing the frontier set is of type U --+ Y, the MDG I representing the set of input vectors is of type U -+ X, and the MDG FT representing the transition relation is of type (XUY) --+ Y~. The result of taking the conjunction of these three MDGs would be of type U ~ (X U Y U Y~), the result of subsequently removing the variables in X U Y by existential quantification would be of type U--+ Y~, and the result of subsequently applying the renaming substitution 7/would be of type U-+ Y. The RelP operation performs these three operations in one pass, and assigns the resulting MDG of type U ~ Y to N. Lines 10 and i1 check whether SetCy(N) C_ SetCy(R) by the same method used in lines 7 and 8 to check whether SetCz(O) C_ SetCz(C). If this is indeed the case, then every state reachable from the frontier set was already in SetCy(R). The fixpoint has been reached and R represents all the reachable states. Therefore, the procedure terminates and reports success. Otherwise the MDG assigned to Q in line 10 represents the new frontier set. Line 12 simplifies R by removing from it any paths that are subsumed by Q, using PhyS. There may be such paths because Q was not computed earlier as an exact difference. Then line 13 computes the new value of R by taking the disjunction of R and Q, which represents the set of states SetCy(R)U Set ¢ (Q), and assigning it to R. In the general case, this procedure may not terminate and may produce false negatives. These limitations are discusses below, in Section 4.2.3 and Section 4.2.4 respectively. 3. M o d e l i n g H a r d w a r e w i t h M D G s A circuit is described at the RT level as a collection of components interconnected by nets that carry signals. Each signal is represented by a variable. Variables denoting control signals have concrete sorts, while variables denoting data values have abstract sorts. We show how various kinds of components can be represented by MDGs through the following examples. The parser in our MDG tools automatically transforms a component predefined in our Prolog-style MDG-HDL [ZhBo95] into its MDG representation. Gates: For gates, the input and output signals are always of Boolean sort. Figure 3.1(a) and Figure 3.1(b) show an OR gate and its MDG representation for a particular ordering of the variables. Boolean MDGs are essentially the same as ROBDDs. Multiplexer: For a two-way multiplexer as shown in Figure 3.2(a), we may have different MDGs depending on the signals being multiplexed. There is a very compact MDG (Figure 3.2(b)) if xl, x2 and y are all of an abstract",,,79,113,Combinatorics; Tuple; State variable; Loop counter; Counterexample; Finite-state machine; Mathematics; Disjoint sets; Invariant (mathematics); Fixed point,,,,,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2,,10.1007/3-540-63475-4_2,84508643,,0,,23,false,,

We define the semantics of concurrent ASMs by concurrent ASM runs which overcome the problems of Gurevich's distributed ASM runs and generalize Lamport's sequentially consistent runs. A postulate characterizing an intuitive understanding of concurrency is formulated. It allows us to state and prove an extension of the sequential ASM thesis to a concurrent ASM thesis.,53,5,469,492,Abstract state machines; Artificial intelligence; Semantics (computer science); Concurrency; Programming language; Theory of computation; Extension (predicate logic); Computer science; State (computer science),,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81790908 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00236-015-0249-7 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00236-015-0249-7 https://paperity.org/p/74503548/concurrent-abstract-state-machines https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00236-015-0249-7 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/acta/acta53.html#BorgerS16 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00236-015-0249-7.pdf https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Methodology/ConcurAsm.pdf https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00236-015-0249-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00236-015-0249-7,,10.1007/s00236-015-0249-7,2205449728,,0,000-719-505-855-221; 000-830-058-619-854; 005-808-345-577-571; 007-698-366-331-536; 011-052-400-879-696; 012-524-624-546-697; 013-371-794-927-216; 014-014-083-828-511; 019-202-064-085-206; 020-473-610-348-465; 022-955-585-690-019; 025-811-569-298-195; 026-830-714-409-083; 028-460-718-356-000; 029-213-608-013-056; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-763-988-083-753; 037-445-945-364-220; 037-765-632-256-264; 040-613-353-385-886; 041-833-409-225-349; 041-863-663-936-741; 045-052-269-923-834; 050-309-871-652-59X; 050-570-622-137-625; 051-207-280-802-006; 052-154-719-858-920; 052-891-645-086-744; 056-820-454-074-473; 058-974-031-275-841; 059-553-350-068-285; 059-751-672-074-693; 060-733-812-776-088; 061-906-386-556-953; 065-277-702-489-526; 067-042-828-672-760; 069-462-098-438-852; 072-884-492-292-431; 077-321-006-820-298; 080-919-172-121-534; 081-636-877-588-544; 082-815-138-851-468; 089-664-162-308-43X; 092-195-924-604-606; 092-288-600-151-842; 093-322-095-729-713; 096-217-330-470-751; 098-944-026-156-091; 100-683-174-205-26X; 105-620-622-527-144; 106-871-695-200-890; 110-568-113-192-118; 111-267-725-928-277; 111-567-034-049-446; 113-330-233-645-723; 113-740-395-634-754; 117-173-452-751-98X; 117-821-177-762-731; 119-426-806-834-674; 119-880-607-450-862; 121-596-474-896-513; 123-242-253-603-830; 125-392-303-019-904; 127-079-227-441-119; 133-375-412-244-057; 135-907-157-457-107; 139-330-264-873-706; 144-592-874-855-231; 147-019-981-692-623; 151-522-501-802-495; 154-550-982-498-232; 155-008-633-941-159; 155-360-261-561-368; 159-450-590-630-808; 182-066-961-461-538; 186-860-254-309-725; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-635-564-405-355,55,true,cc-by,hybrid

In this paper an extension of Abstract State Machines by such expressions is introduced and its usefulness is demonstrated by examples of computations on graphs, such as graph factoring and checking self-similarity. In a naive way these high-level specifications can be refined using submachines for the evaluation of the higher-order expressions.

This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Another use case for aspect orientation in specifications is the extension of specifications without touching the original ones. The definition of formal semantics for UML profiles without changing the original UML specification is an example for this application. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented with aspect specification.

Due to the fact that the ASM approach defines a notion of executing specifications, it provides a perfect basis for a language, which can be used as a specification language as well as a high-level programming language. However, in order to upgrade to a realistic programming language, such a language must - besides other features - add a modularization concept to the core ASM constructs in order to provide the possibility to structure large-scale ASM-formalizations and to flexibly define reusable specification units. In this paper, the language XASM, which stands for Extensible ASM, is presented. XASM realizes a component-based modularization concept based on the notion of external functions as defined in ASMs. This paper also briefly describes the support environment of XASM consisting of the XASM-compiler translating XASM programs to C source code, and the graphical debugging and animation tool.",,,69,90,Abstract state machines; Programming language specification; Debugging; Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Specification language; Computer science; Source code; Component (UML); Modular programming,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#Anlauff00,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#Anlauff00,,,1525145857,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 008-851-666-443-606; 011-714-899-066-773; 019-043-895-820-341; 028-647-212-633-541; 032-014-692-842-661; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-198-279-045-712; 071-836-356-365-947; 073-111-177-402-911; 077-082-840-416-099; 094-512-586-911-230; 094-993-083-147-832; 104-538-400-674-182; 105-374-125-615-695; 122-334-811-271-036; 138-788-046-637-498; 150-188-119-252-720; 155-219-003-803-384; 168-683-312-771-217; 171-752-315-748-404; 199-626-244-193-753,17,false,,

Use Case Maps (UCM) is being standardized as part of the User Requirements Notation (URN), the most recent addition to ITU–T’s family of languages. UCM models allow the description of functional requirements and high-level designs at early stages of the development process. Recognizing the importance of having a well defined semantic, we propose, in this paper, a concise and rigorous formal semantics for Use Case Maps (UCM). The proposed formal semantics addresses UCM’s operational semantics and covers the key language functional constructs. These semantics are defined in terms of Multi-Agent Abstract State Machines that describes how UCM specifications are executed and eliminates ambiguities hidden in the informal language definition. The resulting operational semantics are embedded in an ASM-UCM simulation engine and are expressed in AsmL, an advanced ASM-based executable specification language. The proposed ASM-UCM engine provides an environment for executing and simulating UCM specifications. We illustrate our approach using an example of a simplified call connection.",,,366,380,Semantics; User requirements document; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Artificial intelligence; Operational semantics; Finite-state machine; Parsing; Programming language; Specification language; Computer science; Functional programming; Functional requirement; Formal methods; Semantics of logic; Metamodeling; Abstract machine,Use Case Maps; user requirements notation; abstract state machines; formal semantics; simulation; AsmL,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11562436_27.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11562436_27 https://doi.org/10.1007/11562436_27 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11562436_27 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11562436_27 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11562436_27 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/forte/forte2005.html#HassineRD05,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11562436_27,,10.1007/11562436_27,1581327827,,0,004-401-593-036-028; 017-948-552-487-747; 024-520-614-355-958; 029-179-141-014-285; 029-254-500-592-413; 035-292-927-729-68X; 037-337-501-383-465; 037-523-623-211-361; 044-748-027-808-63X; 046-427-990-981-348; 049-202-123-608-387; 068-833-537-683-192; 072-728-319-349-727; 073-258-060-458-846; 076-073-572-022-016; 086-911-802-907-518; 094-512-586-911-230; 109-552-559-143-618; 124-621-698-081-058; 139-330-264-873-706; 156-704-488-337-056; 157-311-554-599-521; 189-521-689-083-502,16,true,,bronze

In particular, an instance of the ASM model has recently been introduced for computing queries to relational databases. This model, to which we refer as the BGS model, provides a powerful query language in which all computable queries can be expressed. In this paper, we show that when one is only interested in polynomial- time computations, BGS is strictly more powerful than both QL and whilenew, two well-known computationally complete query languages. We then show that when a language such as whilenew is extended with a duplicate elimination mechanism, polynomial-time simulations between the language and BGS become possible.

Our focus is on providing guarantees for changing safety goals at runtime (a form of uncertainty) with the employment of mathematically-based runtime analysis techniques from the area of formal methods (FM@run.time).",1269,,395,410,Distributed computing; Abstract state machines; Software system; Scale (chemistry); Model based simulation; Research community; Focus (computing); Computer science; Resource (project management); Formal methods,,,,,https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/804283 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/182226 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-59155-7_29.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ecsa/ecsa2020c.html#RiccobeneS20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29,,10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29,3085204783,,0,001-833-306-502-090; 006-244-045-917-365; 006-555-745-475-703; 007-318-748-482-113; 007-573-294-174-316; 008-934-244-782-054; 011-298-860-589-104; 012-182-225-373-63X; 013-500-244-308-937; 014-681-314-564-672; 019-113-402-382-947; 034-172-113-754-20X; 035-085-201-399-050; 042-948-378-508-51X; 046-619-832-582-567; 046-838-597-306-588; 067-643-671-325-675; 068-710-809-463-127; 074-005-404-726-279; 074-332-408-277-851; 087-882-692-877-51X; 094-734-717-644-755; 118-344-159-936-803; 120-805-617-467-313; 138-203-276-451-828; 139-330-264-873-706; 164-160-958-762-821; 167-036-940-702-338; 167-896-065-369-695; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,5,false,,

In order to provide the necessary confidence level, with regard to the respect of functional and non-functional properties, a system analysis that accounts for all possible execution paths must be performed. Symbolic execution has been successfully used to explore and analyze reachable system states. In this paper, we formally define a symbolic execution semantics for an abstract state machine based model. The unification of the update semantics redefined in terms of symbolic moves, enable us to achieve reacher methods for path condition resolution and ultimately better scalability of the execution. The goal of this paper is to provide a formal ground for the integration of symbolic execution in existing timing analysis frameworks based on abstract state machines that will facilitate the computability of the analysis tools.",50,1,11251,11256,Concolic testing; Abstract state machines; Computability; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Symbolic trajectory evaluation; Symbolic execution; Computer science; Scalability; Theoretical computer science; Unification,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317322085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.1610,,10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.1610,2765620676,,0,015-855-745-649-209; 053-950-243-449-542; 078-447-480-862-591,2,true,,gold

In particular, we base our work on a translation of general ASMs to full first-order temporal logic. While such a logic is, in general, not finitely axiomatisable, recent work has identified a fragment, termed the monodic fragment, that is finitely axiomatisable and many of its subfragments are decidable. Thus, in this paper, we define a class of monodic ASMs whose semantics in terms of temporal logic fits within the monodic fragment. This, together with recent work on clausal resolution methods for monodic fragments, allows us to carry out temporal verification of monodic ASMs. The approach is illustrated by the deductive verification of FloodSet algorithm for Consensus problem, and Synapse N+1 cache coherence protocol; both are specified by monodic ASMs.",,,95,110,First-order logic; Resolution (logic); Decidability; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Temporal logic; Fragment (logic); Computer science; Linear temporal logic; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/20733418 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_8 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24773-9_8 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2004.html#FisherL04 http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~alexei/publications/ASM2004.pdf http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~alexei/publications/ASM2004.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24773-9_8.pdf https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~alexei/publications/ASM2004.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_8,,10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_8,1775836361,,0,003-051-241-040-986; 003-222-418-546-848; 008-638-531-729-145; 016-566-136-015-791; 018-408-105-437-771; 019-043-895-820-341; 019-808-410-775-645; 028-377-471-186-275; 030-266-627-017-428; 031-310-320-156-556; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-114-762-339-381; 035-704-819-286-111; 037-445-945-364-220; 044-748-027-808-63X; 045-534-655-339-005; 052-995-531-322-274; 054-846-496-589-187; 058-456-910-936-204; 064-763-777-395-02X; 070-756-254-676-748; 072-793-837-418-500; 073-258-060-458-846; 077-837-162-556-510; 084-010-145-144-942; 086-223-977-202-166; 086-719-383-366-007; 087-343-383-278-828; 092-195-924-604-606; 100-638-520-723-965; 105-620-622-527-144; 107-077-171-963-473; 107-301-814-667-752; 110-135-808-466-118; 111-076-093-380-650; 115-830-205-501-718; 122-032-762-876-288; 125-786-745-981-772; 126-722-016-583-006; 127-262-921-163-986; 135-014-474-649-251; 136-913-969-663-579; 139-490-676-623-618; 146-579-344-003-185; 151-231-894-669-989; 155-304-026-125-99X; 157-311-554-599-521; 157-541-600-045-196; 176-197-240-615-472; 176-199-176-888-554; 181-494-707-803-365,3,true,,green

Stärk; Joachim Schmid; Egon Börger,"The notion of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), defined in [20], captures in mathematically rigorous yet transparent form some fundamental operational intuitions of computing, and the notation is familiar from programming practice and mathematical standards. This allows the practitioner to work with ASMs without any further explanation, viewing them as `pseudocode over abstract data’ which comes with a well defined semantics supporting the intuitive understanding. We therefore suggest to skip this chapter and to come back to it only should the need be felt upon further reading.",,,15,28,Abstract state machines; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Selection rule; Boolean algebra; Computer science; Notation; Reading (process),,,,,"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-59495-3_2.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59495-3_2 https://core.ac.uk/display/20752172 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59495-3_2 http://uc-garden.dyndns.org/~huck/univ/AsmBook.pdf http://inis.jinr.ru/sl/Cs_Computer%20science/CsNp_Computability/Boerger%20E.,%20Staerk%20R.%20Abstract%20state%20machines..%20A%20method%20for%20high-level%20system%20design%20and%20analysis%20(Springer%202003)(448s).pdf",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-59495-3_2,,10.1007/978-3-642-59495-3_2,1560870874,,0,000-427-107-788-225; 001-175-297-753-696; 001-628-165-105-311; 001-782-318-726-983; 004-410-486-404-600; 004-691-377-348-738; 005-302-953-693-631; 006-244-045-917-365; 006-558-580-892-106; 007-698-366-331-536; 008-638-531-729-145; 009-890-670-252-077; 010-392-341-004-05X; 012-364-091-648-913; 012-404-275-930-01X; 012-784-544-171-638; 013-303-721-674-938; 013-376-780-105-310; 019-049-590-624-988; 019-870-623-309-549; 020-109-723-397-203; 020-865-153-357-595; 021-003-498-716-896; 023-186-040-384-436; 023-919-528-420-539; 024-520-614-355-958; 028-123-482-947-439; 028-647-212-633-541; 030-565-052-488-463; 032-014-692-842-661; 032-394-000-767-355; 034-400-132-510-675; 034-885-951-018-113; 037-344-714-029-828; 037-839-009-369-768; 038-244-591-495-148; 038-442-695-526-305; 038-746-003-197-305; 040-216-749-039-446; 040-613-353-385-886; 045-252-459-149-487; 046-216-399-297-450; 046-604-679-409-001; 048-760-252-034-316; 050-578-715-624-648; 050-641-078-977-537; 050-930-876-134-72X; 050-995-433-771-903; 051-198-279-045-712; 052-795-698-812-279; 054-371-610-806-91X; 054-498-016-878-652; 054-835-402-128-723; 059-682-993-385-525; 060-046-569-964-120; 062-899-089-690-148; 065-259-163-907-792; 065-448-604-977-79X; 066-288-975-518-599; 067-042-828-672-760; 069-003-369-155-473; 069-050-537-784-263; 069-675-629-269-293; 071-180-469-577-920; 073-822-869-083-529; 076-492-476-018-160; 076-822-750-029-612; 076-969-562-422-894; 079-853-335-989-617; 080-226-308-995-766; 081-399-149-747-504; 086-911-802-907-518; 087-186-960-950-682; 087-318-147-087-275; 087-818-446-104-689; 089-458-469-090-845; 089-821-955-035-108; 091-938-225-239-994; 092-288-600-151-842; 092-393-572-789-578; 093-075-861-245-369; 096-217-330-470-751; 096-932-988-256-420; 099-637-783-373-321; 100-011-765-145-332; 100-578-887-869-723; 101-479-841-267-068; 101-494-291-791-820; 102-549-976-383-880; 104-662-847-268-859; 105-454-480-607-067; 105-620-622-527-144; 110-568-113-192-118; 110-796-339-876-197; 111-667-879-288-092; 112-275-495-453-638; 112-323-824-635-381; 114-591-247-923-343; 116-680-276-099-039; 119-170-113-682-288; 119-426-806-834-674; 119-880-607-450-862; 120-004-676-310-228; 120-767-106-495-115; 121-274-898-277-829; 122-032-762-876-288; 122-334-811-271-036; 125-086-525-203-517; 127-262-921-163-986; 131-134-695-383-398; 131-784-513-023-055; 132-246-550-138-466; 132-648-525-845-187; 135-183-707-405-758; 135-825-815-246-020; 138-094-703-131-205; 139-490-676-623-618; 140-589-324-219-721; 142-535-121-194-332; 143-699-454-044-102; 144-799-896-708-169; 145-506-276-588-893; 147-500-061-251-762; 147-920-708-764-819; 148-186-952-282-718; 148-825-038-998-202; 150-934-871-762-122; 153-862-725-297-76X; 154-000-910-997-626; 154-014-618-688-321; 156-100-028-127-181; 156-248-449-450-930; 156-881-460-819-421; 157-586-062-136-232; 157-731-621-681-981; 158-170-674-288-488; 158-754-379-827-820; 161-581-499-219-980; 161-901-496-343-687; 162-008-052-602-531; 162-950-017-927-35X; 168-683-312-771-217; 176-197-240-615-472; 183-394-089-255-799; 195-099-989-376-792; 195-635-564-405-355; 196-155-916-210-177; 197-730-422-871-375,251,false,,

At the software architecture level, designers combine subsystems into complete systems using different techniques, e.g. ""Architecture Description Languages"" (ADLs). There exists a number of ADLs, each of which is specialized for one or more architectural styles. They are designed by different research groups with different goals in mind corresponding to their mental model on how software architecture can be expressed in the most efficient and elegant way. As a result, ADLs are not compatible with each other, so that it is diffcult to present a homogeneous view of the software architecture of a system assembled from different components. This paper presents an approach how architectural styles can be combined using a concept of ADL-interchange.",,,54,61,Architecture description language; Programming language; Software architecture; Computer science; Reference architecture; Architectural pattern; Software architecture description; Multilayered architecture; Resource-oriented architecture; Systems architecture,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46562-6_5 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-46562-6_5 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ershov/ershov1999.html#Sunbul99 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-46562-6_5.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-46562-6_5,,10.1007/3-540-46562-6_5,1543872550,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 000-665-352-317-367; 034-621-810-710-916; 037-202-299-756-097; 045-229-347-503-933; 062-459-155-371-673; 063-229-748-620-48X; 079-723-355-085-863; 083-157-256-174-335; 091-763-722-274-078; 093-791-114-213-66X; 105-620-622-527-144; 118-261-821-007-918; 137-125-105-744-354; 138-788-046-637-498; 153-838-939-700-462; 154-917-547-547-78X; 158-535-874-671-990,3,false,,

One main difference to data refinement is that ASM refinement considers infinite runs and termination. Since backward simulation does not preserve termination in general, the standard technique of adding history information to the concrete level is not applicable. The powerset construction also adds infinite runs and is therefore not applicable too. This paper shows that a completeness proof is nevertheless possible by adding infinite prophecy information, effectively moving nondetermism to the initial state. Adding such prophecy information can be done on the semantic level, but also by a simple syntactic transformation that removes the choose construct of ASMs. The completeness proof is also ported to give a completeness proof for IO automata.",214,,25,49,Automaton; Transformation (function); Algorithm; Abstract state machines; Completeness (order theory); Simple (abstract algebra); Construct (python library); Computer science; State (computer science),refinement; completeness; abstract state machines; IO automata,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/entcs/entcs214.html#Schellhorn08 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066108003460 https://core.ac.uk/display/81202349 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81202349.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2008.06.003,,10.1016/j.entcs.2008.06.003,2095211351,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 008-703-172-083-503; 015-203-426-052-778; 017-436-380-476-259; 019-070-364-259-296; 019-156-753-656-102; 022-955-585-690-019; 025-983-520-104-880; 026-909-635-119-83X; 036-655-680-064-79X; 040-216-749-039-446; 041-849-666-426-519; 043-306-130-978-579; 046-323-920-158-771; 053-079-247-067-977; 056-487-414-753-82X; 062-813-380-338-385; 065-369-456-390-413; 071-435-929-155-510; 080-491-897-850-043; 083-187-716-670-274; 084-392-463-031-27X; 084-706-046-661-106; 085-295-759-056-62X; 102-345-925-433-986; 105-620-622-527-144; 118-896-053-772-586; 118-958-950-945-388; 120-344-022-077-245; 126-650-758-092-281; 141-490-359-931-352; 142-653-298-375-689; 154-000-910-997-626; 157-311-554-599-521; 161-215-557-312-826; 176-197-240-615-472; 183-377-981-512-798; 184-044-966-704-362; 185-832-320-961-662; 189-521-689-083-502,11,true,,gold

As a basic tool we introduce a ‘modal’ logic of transition rules and runs, which is, in the context of evolving algebras, just a definitional extension of ordinary first order logic. A notion of independence of rules and runs enables us to introduce a notion of (and notation for) concurrent runs, on which a logical theory of (‘true’) concurrency may be based. The notion of concurrent run also has (but does not depend on) an interleaving interpretation. Some basic constructs (concurrent composition, addition of guards and updates) and some derived constructs (internal and external choice, sequential composition) on evolving algebras are introduced and investigated. The power of the framework is demonstrated by developing simple and transparent evolving algebra models for the Chemical Abstract Machine of Berry and Boudol and for the π-calculus of Milner. Their respective notions of parallelism map directly and faithfully to native concurrency of evolving algebras.",,,182,215,First-order logic; Discrete mathematics; Computational logic; Dynamic logic (modal logic); Modal μ-calculus; Concurrency; Interior algebra; Multimodal logic; Mathematics; Linear temporal logic; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-56992-8_13 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/csl/csl92.html#GlavanR92 https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13 https://core.ac.uk/display/23268301 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13,,10.1007/3-540-56992-8_13,1503754652,,0,009-175-578-084-557; 015-964-147-887-074; 018-689-712-347-616; 055-832-141-101-145; 059-367-156-907-824; 061-894-295-420-641; 066-917-332-730-659; 071-499-992-964-807; 073-039-171-325-771; 086-879-408-382-912; 114-591-247-923-343; 131-199-931-529-377; 132-920-378-615-866; 135-825-815-246-020; 147-500-061-251-762; 179-537-609-486-445,27,false,,

They combine advantages of informal and formal methods. Applications of this method motivate a number of computability and decidability problems connected to ASMs. Such problems result for example from the area of verifying properties of ASMs. Their high expressive power leads rather directly to undecidability respectively uncomputability results for most interesting problems in the case of unrestricted ASMs. Consequently, it is rather natural to ask whether there exist expressive classes of ASMs for which we can prove positive decidability and computability results. In this work, we introduce such a class of ASMs. The concept is similar to the one of the guarded fragment of first-order logic. We analyze the expressive power of this class and prove that it is stronger than Datalog LITE and the guarded fragment of first-order fixed point logic.

The distributed ASMs that underpin the SDL semantics are defined in terms of agents that execute ASM programs concurrently, acting on partial views of a global state. The discrete identities of successive global states are ensured by allowing input from the external world only between steps, and by having all agents refer to an external global time. But distributed systems comprising independent agents do not have a natural global time. Nor do they have natural global states. This paper takes well-known concepts from relativity and applies them to ASMs. The spacetime in which an ASM exists and moves is defined, and some properties that must be preserved by transformations of the frame of reference of an ASM are identified. Practical implications of this approach are explored through reservation and web service examples.",,,105,120,Spacetime; Abstract state machines; Theory of relativity; Programming language; Reservation; Global time; Practical implications; Web service; Computer science; Frame of reference; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sam/sam2012.html#Sherratt12 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-36757-1_7 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7,,10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_7,1607441964,,0,005-919-900-156-170; 016-799-163-937-887; 022-955-585-690-019; 024-439-760-568-187; 059-804-639-548-953; 071-908-704-083-293; 079-933-863-590-861; 092-195-924-604-606; 101-704-045-813-337; 105-620-622-527-144; 111-567-034-049-446; 113-740-395-634-754; 133-375-412-244-057; 139-330-264-873-706; 159-279-984-641-596; 189-521-689-083-502,1,false,,

However, for a family of systems that can be easily decomposed in sub-systems, we devise a technique to cope with this problem. To model such systems, we introduce the notion of sequential net of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which represents a system constituted by a set of ASMs such that only one ASM is active at every time. Given a net of ASMs, we first generate a test suite for every ASM in the net, then we combine the tests in order to obtain a test suite for the entire system. We prove that, under some assumptions, the technique preserves coverage of the entire system. We test our approach on a benchmark and we report a web application example for which we are able to generate complete test suites.",7316,,36,50,Model checking; Algorithm; Web application; Benchmark (computing); Abstract state machines; Test suite; Set (abstract data type); Net (mathematics); Computer science; State space,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30885-7_3.pdf https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/209132/2/testSeqMachinesasm12_cameraReady.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30885-7_3 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2012.html#ArcainiBG12 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30885-7_3 https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/testSeqMachinesABZ12.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/27243 https://core.ac.uk/display/22194359 https://core.ac.uk/download/187901157.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30885-7_3,,10.1007/978-3-642-30885-7_3,189987711,,0,004-165-410-572-804; 006-244-045-917-365; 018-408-105-437-771; 021-003-498-716-896; 034-099-892-995-61X; 044-078-481-254-665; 047-299-736-589-511; 083-083-948-326-126; 088-034-630-494-534; 100-710-024-631-053; 107-735-608-364-425; 139-330-264-873-706; 141-846-087-428-28X; 146-579-344-003-185; 147-436-309-880-519; 155-304-026-125-99X; 170-042-235-963-558; 189-521-689-083-502,7,true,,green

They should abstract irrelevant details and provide a precise and complete description of the behaviour of the system. This view of software specification can naturally be expressed by means of Gurevich’s Abstract State Machines (ASMs). There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi) automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We describe, in the form of examples, an abstraction process which starts by extracting an initial ground-level ASM specification from Java source code (with the same core functionality), and ends in a high-level ASM specification at the desired level of abstraction. We argue that this process can be done in a (semi) automated way, resulting in a valuable tool to improve the current software engineering practices.",,,267,283,Software requirements specification; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Software; Java source code; Computer science; Process (engineering); Source code; Abstraction (linguistics); Software development,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32065-2_19 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_19 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/medi/medi2019.html#FerrarottiPMB19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_19,,10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2_19,2981573717,,0,034-400-132-510-675; 038-070-583-690-35X; 040-160-680-572-188; 048-320-513-860-722; 050-578-715-624-648; 058-974-031-275-841; 060-733-812-776-088; 065-277-702-489-526; 069-594-325-063-216; 070-970-525-733-001; 072-130-201-850-819; 087-778-117-287-628; 092-195-924-604-606; 094-728-128-773-013; 101-704-045-813-337; 105-107-714-380-808; 106-871-695-200-890; 111-662-341-262-760; 113-740-395-634-754; 122-718-296-825-040; 130-774-253-656-255; 135-927-047-208-87X; 136-041-173-907-077; 139-330-264-873-706; 158-403-173-954-58X; 189-521-689-083-502,1,false,,

Stärk,We extend the logic for Abstract State Machines by a read predicate that allows to make precise statements about the accesses of locations of an ASM. The logic can be used to prove security properties of ASMs like that the machine does not read locations containing critical information or that all accesses of the machine are in a well-defined region of the abstract memory. The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs. The logic is complete for hierarchical ASMs and still sound for turbo ASMs. It is integrated in the ASMKeY theorem prover.,,,169,185,Predicate (mathematical logic); Abstract state machines; Automated theorem proving; Proof theory; Predicate (grammar); Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_13 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2004.html#NanchenS04,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_13,,10.1007/978-3-540-24773-9_13,1532737022,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 008-638-531-729-145; 016-347-557-587-544; 028-123-482-947-439; 028-506-345-827-164; 033-685-119-299-460; 034-400-132-510-675; 047-716-841-284-351; 050-035-003-144-688; 057-334-826-266-517; 063-233-629-815-382; 075-867-333-727-447; 078-466-392-576-046; 088-447-800-261-940; 122-149-423-286-67X; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-019-981-692-623; 189-521-689-083-502,5,true,,green

It provides message-passing between objects or components specified in different diagrams, including a dispatching mechanism for events, and the handling of actions.

In this work the Asynchronous Multi-Agent Abstract State Machine model is analyzed.

We introduce Abstract State Machine Nets (ASM Nets) whose component ASMs can be defined using a simple combination of textual (data-oriented) and intuitive graphical (control-flow oriented) yet semantically rigorously defined descriptive means. This allows the BP experts to design BPMs whose underlying ASM Nets constitute a reliable precise contract---a contract which guarantees the BP domain experts that the application-domain focussed understanding of the BPMs they design is also a correct understanding of the code behavior provided by the implementation of the models by software experts. This paves the way for the development of certifiably correct BPMs and their implementations. To illustrate one practical and one conceptual application of the concept we a) instantiate ASM Nets to model the behavioral meaning of the graphical and textual notations used in the commercial S-BPM tool suite with its focus on communication (service interaction) and b) show that applying the rigorous ASM refinement concept to ASM Nets supports IBM's Guard-Stage-Milestone approach to adaptive case management by an accurate conceptual foundation.,,,1,10,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Domain (software engineering); Business process modeling; Implementation; Software; Service (systems architecture); Computer science; Component (UML); IBM,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/2723839.2723840 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2723839.2723840 http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Bpmn/AsmNets.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/s-bpm-one/s-bpm-one2015.html#BorgerF15 https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/Bpmn/AsmNets.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2723839.2723840,,10.1145/2723839.2723840,1976005345,,0,005-481-542-380-901; 005-719-893-584-719; 006-178-200-253-237; 013-371-794-927-216; 015-203-426-052-778; 015-705-102-049-054; 016-925-362-718-85X; 022-955-585-690-019; 030-163-063-026-49X; 030-266-627-017-428; 031-883-355-327-261; 033-575-985-011-817; 034-909-791-550-090; 037-839-009-369-768; 040-160-680-572-188; 042-173-965-462-367; 043-160-022-814-818; 049-728-447-157-62X; 050-309-871-652-59X; 051-207-280-802-006; 052-106-375-496-682; 055-600-159-130-793; 059-553-350-068-285; 066-438-289-080-25X; 066-458-503-104-207; 068-653-680-645-983; 072-884-492-292-431; 075-720-252-535-455; 077-628-111-262-511; 080-491-897-850-043; 095-581-760-613-083; 099-193-983-599-312; 100-638-520-723-965; 102-201-064-387-355; 109-226-156-590-33X; 111-076-093-380-650; 113-330-233-645-723; 115-630-405-793-069; 117-821-177-762-731; 123-082-630-503-713; 123-242-253-603-830; 130-708-228-525-901; 137-011-317-915-332; 141-012-865-375-081; 151-873-424-682-606; 152-812-586-213-906; 154-000-910-997-626; 154-550-982-498-232; 178-468-381-979-813; 180-465-279-891-362; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-483-051-287-365,7,false,,

Custom algorithms to verify these properties automatically have been devised for a number of specification languages, including SCR, RSML, and Statecharts. In this paper, we provide means to automatically verify completeness and consistency of Abstract State Machine (ASM) specifications. The verification is performed using a widely available tool, a SAT solver. The use of a SAT solver removes the need for designing and fine tuning language specific verification algorithms. Furthermore, the use of a SAT solver automates the verification procedure and produces a counterexample automatically when a specification is incomplete or inconsistent. We provide an algorithm to translate ASM specifications to a SAT problem instance. The translation is illustrated using the TASM toolset in conjunction with the “production cell system” case study.",190,2,85,97,Consistency (database systems); Abstract state machines; Translation (geometry); Counterexample; Completeness (order theory); Programming language; Computer science; Requirements engineering; Boolean satisfiability problem,Verification; Completeness; Consistency; SAT; Abstract State Machines,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82355825 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/entcs/entcs190.html#OuimetL07 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066107005439 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:237149 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82355825.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2007.08.008,,10.1016/j.entcs.2007.08.008,2058933441,,0,019-911-894-187-65X; 020-579-587-866-103; 020-982-366-508-038; 021-003-498-716-896; 025-241-063-530-442; 029-858-763-538-985; 038-467-272-421-692; 043-254-184-800-221; 050-309-871-652-59X; 050-578-715-624-648; 060-046-569-964-120; 069-561-131-419-172; 092-498-931-461-517; 103-368-289-654-347; 121-190-479-708-008; 132-827-557-546-337; 158-101-134-228-442; 161-466-829-532-053; 167-265-902-026-323,18,true,,gold

ASM is a specification method for software and hardware providing a powerful means of modeling various kinds of systems. MDGs are decision diagrams based on abstract representation of data and are used primarily for modeling hardware systems. The notions of ASM and MDG are hence closely related to each other, making it appealing to link these two concepts. The proposed interface between ASM and MDG uses two steps: first, the ASM model is transformed into a flat, simple transition system as an intermediate model. Second, this intermediate model is transformed into the syntax of the input language of the MDG tool, MDG-HDL. We have successfully applied this transformation scheme on a case study, the Island Tunnel Controller, where we automatically generated the corresponding MDG-HDL models from ASM specifications.",2589,,278,292,Model checking; Formal verification; Abstract state machines; High-level programming language; Programming language; Interface (Java); Software; Transition system; Computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_16 http://core.ac.uk/display/15025085 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:98602 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_16 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#GawanmehTW03 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_16.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_16,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_16,1578760196,,0,002-621-690-811-948; 006-558-580-892-106; 010-392-341-004-05X; 014-695-758-839-777; 019-827-300-450-229; 020-013-882-140-265; 020-212-786-497-100; 025-992-795-669-13X; 032-703-995-573-28X; 039-980-452-061-771; 044-748-027-808-63X; 064-404-416-242-525; 067-114-472-780-831; 071-133-902-038-433; 080-776-799-398-806; 085-647-232-787-131; 105-374-125-615-695; 107-137-949-458-147,11,false,,

Following the approach of Blass and Gurevich to parallel algorithms, we then formulate general postulates for quantum algorithms and show that every algorithm satisfying these postulates is simulated by an appropriate ASM.

Fruja; Robert F. Stärk,"Turbo Abstract State Machines are ASMs with parallel and sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. Turbo ASMs are viewed as black-boxes that can combine arbitrary many steps of one or more submachines into one big step. The intermediate steps of a turbo ASM are not observable from outside. It is not even clear what exactly the intermediate steps are, because the semantics of turbo ASMs is usually defined inductively along the call graph of the ASM and the structure of the rule bodies. The most important application of turbo ASMs are recursive algorithms. Such algorithms can directly be simulated on turbo ASMs without transforming them into multi-agent (distributed) ASMs. In this article we analyze the hidden intermediate steps of turbo ASMs and characterize them using PAR/SEQ trees. We also address the problem of the reserve in the presence of recursion and sequential composition.

Such systems are characterized by high complexity and heterogeneity. Maintaining a high-level availability and a normal execution of the components implies precise monitoring and robust adaptation. Monitors capture relevant metrics and transform them to meaningful knowledge, which is further used in justifying adaptation actions. The current paper proposes an Abstract State Machine model for defining monitoring processes addressing failures and unavailability of the system nodes. The specification is simulated and validated with the aid of the ASMETA toolset. The solution is complemented with a small ontology reflecting the structure of the system.

For this purpose we use abstract state machines (ASMs). Here we describe a particular case study: modeling a debugger of a stack based runtime environment. The study provides evidence for ASMs being a suitable tool for building executable models of software systems on various abstraction levels, with precise refinement relationships connecting the models.

The server model is focussed on the Request-Reply pattern, and specifies a delegation strategy where the handling of a request is entrusted to a module. We show how several major frameworks for web applications can be described as progressive refinements of a number of basic modules. Three modules are further detailed: static file transfer, CGI and generic scripting modules. We provide ASM models of a script-capable web browser and a modules-based web server.Particular care is devoted to those aspects that allow executing modern web applications.These models have explanatory value in themselves, and could be used for a more formal validation.In addition, we show how a continuation-passing semantics can be used to good effect in ASM models.",94,,69,92,Web server; Web API; Web modeling; Web-based simulation; Static web page; Client-side scripting; Programming language; Web page; Computer science; Web navigation,Web applications; Abstract State Machines; JavaScript,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/80256918 http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/SwEngg/WebApplInfrastructureSCP14.pdf https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000926 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp94.html#GervasiBC14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167642314000926 https://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/Papers/SwEngg/WebApplInfrastructureSCP14.pdf https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80256918.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025,,10.1016/j.scico.2014.02.025,2085797030,,0,021-878-070-887-207; 022-955-585-690-019; 024-563-953-605-747; 025-000-672-252-436; 026-929-059-967-491; 030-694-560-871-857; 033-348-523-609-013; 034-909-791-550-090; 036-602-408-908-78X; 040-216-749-039-446; 043-089-235-712-971; 059-553-350-068-285; 060-776-050-843-781; 062-160-210-772-466; 063-056-611-041-388; 065-383-421-518-123; 065-891-220-000-986; 072-884-492-292-431; 077-315-391-882-67X; 096-754-613-880-295; 098-685-870-265-425; 101-704-045-813-337; 123-082-630-503-713; 137-011-317-915-332; 154-896-114-434-819; 178-607-662-063-948; 189-521-689-083-502; 195-635-564-405-355,2,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,green

We formalise this problem by the notion of the greatest consistent specialisation (GCS) adapting and generalising this 20 year old concept to sequential Abstract State Machines (ASMs) with emphasis on bounded parallelism. In a state satisfying I such that P is repairable the notion of consistent specialisation will require an enlargement of the update set, which defines a partial order with respect to which a GCS is defined. We show that GCSs are compositional in two respects: (1) the GCS of an ASM with a complex rule can be obtained from the GCSs of the involved assignments, and (2) the GCS with respect to a set of invariants can be built using the GCSs for the individual invariants in the set.",,,219,235,Discrete mathematics; Principle of compositionality; Abstract state machines; Enforcement; Program specification; First order; Bounded function; Computer science; Invariant (mathematics); Successor cardinal,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32409-4_14 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icfem/icfem2019.html#Schewe19 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,,10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,2982526712,,0,003-747-112-190-035; 015-574-147-878-609; 021-750-860-201-879; 031-058-645-527-712; 034-400-132-510-675; 040-440-509-441-854; 042-151-895-979-653; 050-309-871-652-59X; 058-974-031-275-841; 066-006-964-963-613; 085-098-810-136-199; 089-353-438-562-001; 108-925-457-506-038; 127-988-145-609-81X; 139-330-264-873-706; 150-827-661-654-162; 153-474-475-731-687; 160-530-367-454-325; 186-076-165-513-653,0,false,,

The composition of multiple parties' business processes is always done with a specific objective in mind. Not only in the positive case, but also if the objective of a business process can not be fulfilled, all participating business processes need to be in some expected recovery state. We propose a composition algorithm solving the task of designing a collaborative business process while respecting a set of primary and recovery goals. In our model, each business process is described as a finite state machine. The multiplication of all business processes in one single model of possible executions would lead to an explosion of the number of states. Therefore, our composition algorithm directly interprets the multiple finite state machine (FSM) representations and creates a collaborative business process without integrating all FSMs into a single FSM upfront. Our composition algorithm returns an orchestration of the given business processes only in the case that it can be assured that each execution only leads to an expected primary or recovery goal. In order to prove our concepts, we first mathematically define the execution of business processes and orchestrations by providing abstract state machine (ASM) representations for them. Second, we execute the ASMs in the execution engine CoreASM which shows that the generated orchestration steers the execution of the business processes as intended.",,,262,269,Business rule; Software engineering; Artifact-centric business process model; Business Process Model and Notation; Business domain; Programming language; Business process modeling; Computer science; Business Process Execution Language; Business process management; Business process discovery,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4278806/ https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/services/2007/29260262/12OmNzdoN0s http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004278806 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/IEEEscc/scw2007.html#LemckeF07 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4278806/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/services.2007.24,,10.1109/services.2007.24,2095544716,,0,050-309-871-652-59X; 053-082-645-846-05X; 060-776-050-843-781; 139-330-264-873-706; 153-335-556-174-472; 189-521-689-083-502,16,true,,green

Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code.

We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach.

Such partial updates need to be efficiently checked for consistency and integrated. This is the problem of partial updates in a nutshell. In our first paper on the subject we proposed a general solution of the partial-update problem for abstract state machines (ASMs) where the problem is exacerbated by the use of nested submachines; in particular we solved the problem in the cases of counters, sets and maps. Here we propose a more general framework that allows us to solve the problem for sequences and labeled ordered trees. The partial update problem for sequences is related to the problem of collaborative editing.",2589,,57,86,Algorithm; Consistency (database systems); Abstract state machines; Set (abstract data type); Query language; Specification language; Collaborative editing; Sequence; Computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_4 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_4 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/156-partial-updates-exploration/ https://core.ac.uk/display/20856124 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#GurevichT03 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/opera/156.pdf https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/156.pdf https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=81202 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_4.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_4,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_4,1573630376,,1,002-438-766-985-114; 046-216-399-297-450; 079-723-355-085-863; 092-195-924-604-606,9,false,,

Paiva; Nikolai Tillmann; João Pascoal Faria; Raul Moreira Vidal,"This paper presents a new approach to model and test hierarchical Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). We exploit the structure of Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs) to reduce the number of states in the ”flat” Finite State Machine (FSM) resulting from the exploration of the model. Firstly, independent dialogs are identified and highlighted in a HFSM built from the FSM. Then, the portion of the FSM that describes each dialog is reduced. To illustrate the approach, we construct a model of the Notepad application, which is part of Microsoft Windows. The model is written in Spec] and is converted automatically to a FSM using the Spec Explorer tool developed at Microsoft Research. The HFSM is then defined and the total number of states of the FSM is reduced. Spec Explorer generates test cases from the FSM, and also tests the conformity between the specification and the implementation.",,,329,344,Engineering; Test case; Finite-state machine; Dialog box; Structure (mathematical logic); Programming language; Engineering drawing; Spec#; Construct (python library); Graphical user interface; Microsoft Windows,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#PaivaTFV05 https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~jpf/research/ASM05.pdf https://web.fe.up.pt/~jpf/research/ASM05.pdf https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/95648 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raul_Vidal2/publication/37650636_Modeling_and_Testing_Hierarchical_GUIs/links/00b49517f9e867d2c3000000.pdf http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#PaivaTFV05,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#PaivaTFV05,,,1545078856,,0,004-165-410-572-804; 014-611-582-735-809; 028-448-364-580-352; 047-031-490-420-021; 050-578-715-624-648; 052-766-080-234-187; 063-871-329-757-009; 105-620-622-527-144; 106-750-278-899-505; 146-579-344-003-185; 155-304-026-125-99X; 165-584-583-684-26X,45,false,,

The Abstract State Machine Theorem states that every classical algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to an abstract state machine. This theorem presupposes three natural postulates about algorithmic computation. Here, we show that augmenting those postulates with an additional requirement regarding basic operations gives a natural axiomatization of computability and a proof of Church's Thesis, as Godel and others suggested may be possible. In a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations, one can prove Turing's Thesis, characterizing the effective string functions, and—in particular—the effectively-computable functions on string representations of numbers.",14,3,299,350,Computability theory; μ-recursive function; Algebra; Computability; Algorithm characterizations; utm theorem; Turing machine; Computer science; Computable function; Church–Turing thesis,effective computation; recursiveness; computable functions; Church's Thesis; Turing's Thesis; abstract state machines; algorithms; encodings,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/188-a-natural-axiomatization-of-churchs-thesis/ http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/papers/Church.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/DERANA https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-symbolic-logic/volume-14/issue-3/A-natural-axiomatization-of-computability-and-proof-of-Churchs-Thesis/10.2178/bsl/1231081370.full http://engr.case.edu/ray_soumya/mlrg/CTthesis-proof_bsl08.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bsl/bsl14.html#DershowitzG08 https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A63FCE2FEF1F59E42FFFD5980451DB02/S1079898600001591a.pdf/div-class-title-a-natural-axiomatization-of-computability-and-proof-of-church-s-thesis-div.pdf https://doi.org/10.2178/bsl/1231081370 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/188-A-Natural-Axiomatization-of-Computability-and-Proof-of-Churchs-Thesis.pdf https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-symbolic-logic/article/natural-axiomatization-of-computability-and-proof-of-churchs-thesis/A63FCE2FEF1F59E42FFFD5980451DB02 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/Opera/188.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2178/bsl/1231081370,,10.2178/bsl/1231081370,2121136774,,0,000-452-980-157-289; 000-490-410-327-490; 000-745-232-131-816; 000-848-924-855-438; 001-155-622-988-90X; 001-332-641-484-998; 003-703-693-880-100; 004-511-981-278-405; 005-694-138-735-992; 006-123-740-083-381; 006-885-253-431-458; 008-328-610-164-089; 010-428-026-662-337; 011-052-400-879-696; 012-692-592-286-626; 015-263-850-899-542; 015-545-391-248-630; 015-940-092-888-179; 016-110-051-799-528; 017-119-407-730-546; 020-455-388-549-59X; 022-439-730-493-089; 023-356-507-873-233; 023-381-709-084-114; 026-671-476-867-357; 026-866-404-502-906; 028-826-512-349-757; 031-014-835-610-66X; 031-091-098-464-621; 031-909-553-637-650; 033-859-113-440-045; 034-141-805-902-697; 034-292-361-589-705; 034-400-132-510-675; 035-596-043-724-640; 039-338-372-562-025; 039-684-420-480-326; 041-406-781-361-711; 041-863-663-936-741; 048-161-579-385-623; 048-495-703-402-68X; 050-639-990-254-545; 053-956-836-134-180; 058-333-645-536-321; 060-733-812-776-088; 062-050-951-767-86X; 069-050-537-784-263; 071-062-211-635-76X; 075-726-279-151-424; 078-457-147-947-291; 080-124-501-272-546; 081-533-716-212-982; 081-564-980-994-874; 082-815-138-851-468; 085-568-322-618-811; 085-994-097-594-260; 089-355-190-014-421; 091-627-852-966-703; 091-938-225-239-994; 092-195-924-604-606; 094-605-927-503-95X; 094-722-028-432-118; 097-885-033-876-878; 099-637-042-899-342; 100-147-890-524-932; 100-481-746-689-744; 103-432-912-443-001; 104-924-219-415-405; 107-925-596-602-568; 111-567-034-049-446; 112-454-167-232-434; 118-838-030-263-345; 119-544-652-264-927; 120-263-822-258-648; 124-596-904-246-510; 126-998-030-149-801; 127-378-052-232-437; 129-892-066-656-075; 131-396-163-070-42X; 133-375-412-244-057; 135-653-596-353-169; 136-172-709-816-588; 137-848-674-073-887; 139-568-494-499-932; 146-836-542-531-151; 148-150-646-951-560; 156-636-121-714-183; 157-311-554-599-521; 162-442-853-238-997; 163-330-902-847-052; 163-714-037-994-834; 169-073-447-115-709; 172-419-564-595-602; 172-695-740-783-014; 178-558-813-883-946; 180-946-583-583-046; 187-371-742-557-006; 192-732-079-596-552; 195-635-564-405-355; 195-652-824-339-257; 198-078-863-486-538,113,true,,bronze

Universal Comput. Sci. 7 (2001) 952), we have formalized Borger's refinement notion for Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The formalization was based on transition systems and verification conditions were expressed in Dynamic Logic.In this paper, the relation between ASM refinement and data refinement is explored. Data refinement expresses operations and verification conditions using relational calculus.We show how to bridge the gap between the different notations, and that forward simulation in the behavioral approach to data refinement can be viewed as a specific instance of ASM refinement with 1:1 diagrams, where control structure is not refined.We also prove that two recent generalizations of data refinement, weak refinement and coupled refinement can be derived from ASM refinement.",336,2,403,435,Algorithm; Refinement; Abstract state machines; Finite-state machine; Diagram; Structure (mathematical logic); Relation (database); Computer science; Notation; Refinement calculus,abstract state machines; refinement; data refinement,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.013 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397504007819#! http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.013 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tcs/tcs336.html#Schellhorn05 https://core.ac.uk/display/21082122 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304397504007819,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.013,,10.1016/j.tcs.2004.11.013,2048884567,,0,001-668-881-085-733; 006-558-580-892-106; 017-436-380-476-259; 019-070-364-259-296; 019-156-753-656-102; 022-955-585-690-019; 026-516-654-515-435; 026-909-635-119-83X; 036-697-695-015-742; 040-216-749-039-446; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-792-824-877-314; 056-487-414-753-82X; 065-369-456-390-413; 073-111-177-402-911; 078-550-202-637-883; 083-187-716-670-274; 092-876-325-760-504; 105-620-622-527-144; 120-344-022-077-245; 126-230-038-949-717; 126-650-758-092-281; 141-519-271-889-571; 154-000-910-997-626; 157-311-554-599-521; 161-215-557-312-826; 171-140-957-405-705; 183-377-981-512-798; 184-044-966-704-362; 199-657-913-669-336,59,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

Specifically, we focus here on testing situation analysis decision support models for marine safety & security operations as a sample application domain. Arguably, methodical approaches for analyzing and validating situation analysis methods, decision support models, and information fusion algorithms require realistic vignettes that describe in great detail how a situation unfolds over time depending on initial configurations, dynamic environmental conditions and uncertain operational aspects. Meaningful results from simulation runs require appropriate test cases, the production of which is in itself a complex activity. To simplify this task, we introduce here the conceptual design of a Vignette Generator that has been developed and tested in an industrial research project.

Ejnioui; Carlos E. Otero; Abrar A. Qureshi,"The latest specification of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.x revised completely the structure and elements of sequence diagrams by expanding their modularity via interaction fragments. These fragments are based on a set of operators that can simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of events in the diagram. Unfortunately, the new revision introduced a significant degree of ambiguity in the interpretation of these diagrams. This ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that different styles of sequence diagrams can be used for different purposes of modeling and analysis. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. The approach in this paper assumes that lifeline processes in a sequence diagram act as autonomous agents that communicate by exchanging messages among each other in asynchronous and distributed manner. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and constraints.",,,71,76,Unified Modeling Language; Block diagram; Sequence diagram; Operational semantics; Story-driven modeling; Class diagram; Computer science; Communication diagram; Theoretical computer science; System sequence diagram,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2512209.2512211 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/riit/riit2013.html#EjniouiOQ13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2512209.2512211,,10.1145/2512209.2512211,1993758430,,0,012-032-484-394-263; 043-458-843-275-841; 069-632-731-573-953; 072-936-896-406-37X; 097-051-009-132-034; 125-735-518-317-29X; 139-330-264-873-706; 156-564-161-443-330; 159-976-005-385-976; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

We present an improved algorithm which rectifies the weaknesses of the original algorithm, as well as a practical, fully functional choreography engine implementation in Flora-2 based on the improved algorithm. Our improvements to the choreography algorithm include (i) the linking of the initial state of the ASM to the precondition of the goal, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a final state in the execution of the ASM and its linking to the postcondition of the goal, and (iii) modification to the execution of the ASM so that it stops when the final state condition is satisfied by the current configuration of the machine. Our choreography engine takes as input semantic web service specifications written in the Flora-2 dialect of F-logic. Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of ASMs (evolving algebras) and evolving ontologies in the sense that one can simulate the other, a first in literature.

Due to the fact that the ASM approach defines a notion of executing specifications, it provides a perfect basis for a language, which can be used as a specification language as well as a high-level programming language. However, in order to upgrade to a realistic programming language, such a language must — besides other features — add a modularization concept to the core ASM constructs in order to provide the possibility to structure large-scale ASM-formalizations and to flexibly define reusable specification units. In this paper, the language Xasm, which stands for Extensible ASM, is presented. Xasm realizes a component-based modularization concept based on the notion of external functions as defined in ASMs. This paper also briefly describes the support environment of Xasm consisting of the Xasm-compiler translating Xasm programs to C source code, and the graphical debugging and animation tool.",,,69,90,Low-level programming language; Abstract state machines; Programming language specification; Debugging; Compiler; Component-based software engineering; High-level programming language; Programming language; Specification language; Language primitive; Runtime system; Extensibility; Computer science; Source code; Component (UML); First-generation programming language; Modular programming; Abstract machine,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/57045635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_6,127868156,,3,000-490-410-327-490; 008-851-666-443-606; 011-714-899-066-773; 019-043-895-820-341; 028-647-212-633-541; 032-014-692-842-661; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-198-279-045-712; 054-846-496-589-187; 069-180-238-940-145; 071-836-356-365-947; 073-111-177-402-911; 077-082-840-416-099; 079-723-355-085-863; 083-972-922-498-894; 094-512-586-911-230; 094-993-083-147-832; 104-538-400-674-182; 105-374-125-615-695; 105-620-622-527-144; 122-334-811-271-036; 138-788-046-637-498; 150-188-119-252-720; 151-880-343-919-54X; 155-219-003-803-384; 168-683-312-771-217; 171-752-315-748-404; 199-626-244-193-753,65,false,,

084-042-001-872-381,Decoupling web application concerns through weaving operations,,2008,journal article,Science of Computer Programming,01676423,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Antonio Cicchetti; Davide Di Ruscio,"Today's Web applications require instruments and techniques able to face their complexity which has noticeably increased at the expense of productivity and quality factors. A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the ''everything is a model'' principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or WebML.",70,1,62,86,Software engineering; Web application; Web modeling; Abstract state machines; Modeling language; Programming language; Decoupling (probability); Reuse; Computer science; Weaving; Metamodeling,Abstract state machines; Model transformations; Model weaving; Web applications; Metamodel specification,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82464042 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/scp/scp70.html#CicchettiR08 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:679443 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642307001566 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82464042.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002,,10.1016/j.scico.2007.10.002,1994426217,,0,003-601-413-754-373; 005-460-957-985-387; 006-017-693-692-950; 007-123-372-908-904; 008-015-330-076-941; 010-193-530-630-533; 010-731-917-239-059; 011-895-798-909-79X; 012-762-503-620-399; 013-352-634-535-287; 013-373-940-400-826; 014-875-365-850-914; 020-013-882-140-265; 028-576-186-413-880; 029-943-697-329-478; 031-266-755-714-363; 032-612-267-314-323; 037-812-871-655-069; 043-956-404-991-194; 045-062-382-799-07X; 053-631-785-808-409; 054-180-513-727-222; 055-611-152-010-311; 060-733-812-776-088; 060-754-234-319-426; 064-171-683-967-366; 064-397-334-771-009; 076-767-312-466-020; 077-081-857-656-756; 077-951-050-880-059; 081-533-568-202-802; 082-714-949-563-192; 082-867-331-821-855; 100-011-765-145-332; 105-956-396-632-251; 109-181-626-246-60X; 116-956-993-545-841; 121-108-933-012-073; 123-381-573-865-362; 124-736-384-157-830; 129-399-852-618-27X; 134-007-742-290-854; 135-695-271-107-707; 145-070-700-492-395; 147-500-061-251-762; 155-855-852-192-343; 161-197-795-750-614; 162-035-724-191-880; 163-880-481-558-215; 171-937-152-425-23X; 174-005-299-118-911; 175-872-624-816-96X; 195-946-411-840-792; 199-111-743-234-174,19,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

This may lead to surprising results not anticipated by the programmer. The problem is exacerbated by common compiler and hardware optimization techniques. A memory (consistency) model provides a contract between the system designer and the software designer that constrains the order in which operations are observed. Every memory model strikes some balance between strictness (simplifying program behavior) and laxness (permitting greater optimization).; ; With its emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, the Java programming language needs a memory model that is satisfactory to language users and implementors. Everyone in the Java community must be able to understand the Java memory model and its ramifications. The description of the original Java memory model suffered from ambiguity and opaqueness, and attempts to interpret it revealed serious deficiencies. Two memory models have been proposed as replacements. Unfortunately, these two new models are described at different levels of abstraction and are represented in different formats, making it difficult to compare them. In this paper we formalize these models and develop a unified representation of them, using Abstract State Machines. Using our formal specifications, we relate the new Java memory models to the Location Consistency memory model and to each other.",2589,,166,185,Scala; Memory model; Real time Java; Shared memory; Java annotation; Compiler; Generics in Java; strictfp; Java concurrency; Optimizing compiler; Programming language; Programmer; Computer science; Multiprocessing; Java; Java Modeling Language; Abstract machine; Distributed memory; Java Memory Model,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_9 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_9 http://cs.sookmyung.ac.kr/~chang/java/varsha.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/24304671 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#AwhadW03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_9,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_9,2155244944,,0,003-222-418-546-848; 004-479-156-276-701; 011-919-743-722-067; 019-472-104-625-693; 020-579-587-866-103; 023-299-224-157-984; 026-924-949-195-11X; 031-203-850-407-769; 034-728-900-389-951; 041-863-663-936-741; 055-426-770-822-814; 057-009-218-468-036; 059-553-350-068-285; 061-388-520-187-873; 070-081-648-718-75X; 072-682-264-955-701; 073-111-177-402-911; 076-432-416-285-182; 076-805-810-934-32X; 077-661-241-991-477; 078-527-782-859-515; 084-403-590-680-96X; 099-851-634-677-214; 105-620-622-527-144; 116-369-894-387-853; 119-165-273-849-503; 119-426-806-834-674; 122-322-242-208-513; 127-079-227-441-119; 132-648-525-845-187; 134-465-338-153-91X; 141-958-568-357-845; 149-490-863-737-015; 178-855-395-032-583; 195-635-564-405-355,4,false,,

ASMs gained much attention as a specification method. It is extremely flexible because any mathematical structure may serve as a state. Gurevich characterized the expressive power of ASMs in terms of intuitively convincing postulates. The core result of this paper shows that the next-state function M of an Abstract State Machine M can be described on a symbolic level, notwithstanding the generality of the model: The successor state M(S) of a state S is fully specified by the equivalence ~""S induced by S on the terms over the signature of M. Consequently, M(S) is computable in case ~""S is decidable. Furthermore, this result implies a notion of computability for general structures, e.g. for algorithms operating on real numbers.",409,1,126,136,Symbolic computation; Discrete mathematics; Mathematical structure; Abstract state machines; Computability; Decidability; State (functional analysis); Mathematics; Function (mathematics); Abstract machine,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397508006270 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397508006270 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tcs/tcs409.html#Reisig08 https://core.ac.uk/display/82607405 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2008.08.041 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2008.08.041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2008.08.041,,10.1016/j.tcs.2008.08.041,1977996496,,0,022-955-585-690-019; 034-400-132-510-675; 043-175-901-571-703; 058-333-645-536-321; 064-139-089-209-802; 077-272-394-681-526; 110-974-494-206-539; 111-076-093-380-650; 157-311-554-599-521,7,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

Patel,"This work presents a high-level synthesis methodology that uses the abstract state machines (ASMs) formalism as an intermediate representation (IR). We perform scheduling and allocation on this IR, and generate synthesizable VHDL. We have the following advantages when using ASMs as an IR: 1) it allows the specification of both sequential and parallel computation, 2) it supports an extension of a clean timing model based on an interpretation of the sequential semantics, and 3) it has well-defined formal semantics, which allows the integration of formal methods into the methodology. While we specify our designs using ASMs, we do not mandate this. Instead, one can create translators that convert the algorithmic specifications from C-like languages into their equivalent ASM specifications. This makes the hardware synthesis transparent to the designer. We experiment our methodology with examples of a FIR, microprocessor, and an edge detecteor. We synthesize these designs and validate our designs on an FPGA.",,,1,6,Formal specification; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Finite-state machine; Programming language; VHDL; Computer science; Hardware description language; Field-programmable gate array; High-level synthesis; Formal methods; Intermediate language; Semantics of logic,,,,,https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rsinha/research/pubs/date2011.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/date/date2011.html#SinhaP11 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5763227/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/date.2011.5763227,,10.1109/date.2011.5763227,2117703006,,3,021-672-197-345-911; 045-930-416-342-455; 060-776-050-843-781; 070-834-845-151-602; 072-782-888-636-23X; 077-492-877-531-383; 136-058-395-694-880; 190-415-617-582-392,4,false,,

We argue that with respect to compiler correctness this is the best possible result which can be achieved in practice. Such a compiler may even include unverified code provided the results of such code can be proven correct independently from how they are generated.We then show how abstract state machines (ASMs) can be used to uniformly describe the dynamic semantics of the programs being compiled across the various intermediate transformation steps occurring within a compiler. Besides being a convenient tool for describing dynamic semantics the fact that we do not have to switch between different descriptional methods is found to be extremely useful.,,,177,202,Interprocedural optimization; Code generation; Compiler; Programming language; Dead code elimination; Functional compiler; Loop-invariant code motion; Computer science; Compiler correctness; Compiler construction,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#GoosZ00,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#GoosZ00,,,1593001461,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 001-384-311-289-414; 001-989-794-237-089; 010-999-872-320-79X; 012-762-815-979-739; 019-366-530-656-995; 023-186-040-384-436; 035-752-682-434-342; 035-897-579-262-885; 040-153-331-779-185; 042-135-778-101-681; 051-152-325-947-810; 063-229-748-620-48X; 063-289-368-689-017; 063-793-190-367-848; 067-828-056-745-804; 071-335-149-991-456; 078-888-657-554-361; 088-012-407-050-722; 096-176-316-924-819; 102-731-412-156-616; 107-181-398-856-939; 115-161-215-406-065; 117-064-482-725-835; 120-878-624-757-199; 121-055-070-486-524; 121-590-143-006-291; 122-334-811-271-036; 126-077-299-012-406; 137-568-059-588-188; 142-935-994-845-889; 153-494-399-867-395; 156-704-488-337-056; 158-170-674-288-488; 184-044-966-704-362; 191-906-226-300-418,12,false,,

Their formal background makes them suited for proofs, their refinement design method eases the system engineering and their apparent simplicity steepens the end user's learning curve. The numerous extensions that followed have adapted the ASMs to most of the real-time system needs. Our aim is to provide a safe, precise and adaptable worst-case execution time (WCET) estimation for processors featuring modern components. The safety property implies that among all the possible processor states, generated by the binary for all possible inputs, the ones that cause the maximal execution time must be considered. However, complex architectural components, designed to speedup the average case, make it impossible to infer local timing decisions to the global systems as the monotony is broken by the timing anomalies. Therefore, a large number of states must be analysed, generating a combinatorial explosion. Our approach starts with a value analysis of the binary code performed by abstract interpretation. The inherent imprecision of its results is taken into account by the initially concrete abstract state machine processor model. Through the use of an internal oracle, it can dynamically adapt to the lack or imprecision of information by choosing a different hierarchy level for all the impacted components. This kind of execution optimises the granularity of the run based on several strategies. State merging is also used, in order to further counter the state space explosion, in the detriment of precision. The merging is based on identified similar states through the use of equivalence classes. This also offers a leverage on the tradeoff between the precision and scalability of the analysis. Time, different abstraction levels of the processor during the same run and symbolic execution are directly added in the ASM model, as opposed to other approaches. This provides us with the needed architectural adaptability and full control over the main target of the analysis: precise WCET estimation. Taking into account a new processor becomes an engineering task as a new model for the processor is given in our extension of the ASM, with little syntactical differences. This in made possible by the seamless integration of the WCET estimation alongside the ASM semantics, which must not be changed whenever a new platform is considered.",,,,,Computer engineering; Combinatorial explosion; Abstract state machines; Symbolic execution; Abstract interpretation; Computer science; Scalability; Oracle; Binary code; Speedup; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214957/document https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214957,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01214957,,,2740888784,,0,,0,false,,

At runtime, undesirable behaviors of the implementation, as well as incorrect specifications of the system behavior are recognized.; ; The technique we propose makes use of Java annotations, which link the concrete implementation to its formal model, without enriching the code with behavioral information contained only in the abstract specification.

We aim to remain as close as possible to the standard definition of UML and to cover the operational part of the language with particular attention to the behavior description based on actions. To remain close to the standard UML, we automatically translate the UML metamodel in ASM. This allows to take into account all the concepts and relationships contained in the standard, and to minimize the changes subsequent to the frequent updates of the standard.; ; For the dynamic part, the particularity of our approach is that we focus on actions, as defined in our proposal to the OMG action semantics working group. We deal with concurrency, signal exchange, operation calls, general communication primitives, etc. We do not define the semantics of state machines, but we clearly define their place within the framework of our semantics.

When considering Algebraic Petri nets (APNs) for modeling and model checking for verification, all the proofs must be redone after each iteration which is impractical both in terms of time and space.

099-346-724-924-680,On the Understandability of Language Constructs to Structure the State and Behavior in Abstract State Machine Specifications: A Controlled Experiment,,2021,journal article,Journal of Systems and Software,01641212,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Philipp Paulweber; Georg Simhandl; Uwe Zdun,"Abstract Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known state-based formal method to analyze and specify software and hardware systems. As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed modeling languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to structure state and behavior aspects of specifications. Modern object-oriented languages offer a variety of advanced language constructs, and most of them either offer interfaces, mixins, or traits in addition to classes and inheritance. Our goal is to investigate these language constructs in the context of state-based formal methods using ASMs as a representative of this kind of formal methods. We report on a controlled experiment with 105 participants to study the understandability of the three language constructs in the context of ASMs. Our hypotheses are influenced by the debate of object-oriented communities. We hypothesized that the understandability (measured by correctness and duration variables) shows significantly better understanding for interfaces and traits compared to mixins, as well as at least a similar or better understanding for traits compared to interfaces. The results indicate that understandability of interfaces and traits show a similar good understanding, whereas mixins shows a poorer understanding.

In this paper we propose a technique to perform automatic review of Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal specifications. We first detect a family of typical vulnerabilities and defects a developer can introduce during the modeling activity using the ASMs and we express such faults as the violation of meta-properties that guarantee certain quality attributes of the specification. These meta-properties are then mapped to temporal logic formulas and model checked for their violation. As a proof of concept, we also report the result of applying this ASM review process to several specifications.",,,4,13,Formal specification; Proof of concept; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Temporal logic; System development; Review process; Computer science,,,,,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20100018554/downloads/20100018554.pdf https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/154546 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/564316 https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/research/papers/nfm10.pdf https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/25160 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100018554.pdf https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/154546/2/NASA-CP-2010-216215.pdf https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/NFM2010/talks/arcaini.pdf https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/NFM2010/papers/nfm2010_4_13.pdf,https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/154546,,,2183365895,,0,032-354-281-297-321; 034-400-132-510-675; 038-533-472-164-312; 040-736-326-793-892; 062-778-162-008-686; 064-890-246-394-724; 069-561-131-419-172; 082-000-720-773-277; 117-861-031-589-813; 140-817-112-090-657; 155-426-160-695-761; 189-521-689-083-502,28,false,,

As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to express structural and behavioral aspects of specifications. Our goal is to investigate object-oriented abstractions such as interfaces and traits for ASM-based specification languages. We report on a controlled experiment with 98 participants to study the specification efficiency and effectiveness in which participants needed to comprehend an informal specification as problem (stimulus) in form of a textual description and express a corresponding solution in form of a textual ASM specification using either interface or trait syntax extensions. The study was carried out with a completely randomized design and one alternative (interface or trait) per experimental group. The results indicate that specification effectiveness of the traits experiment group shows a better performance compared to the interfaces experiment group, but specification efficiency shows no statistically significant differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study studying the specification effectiveness and efficiency of object-oriented abstractions in the context of formal methods.",30,4,1,29,Empirical research; Abstract state machines; Programming language; Interface (Java); Context (language use); Syntax (programming languages); Computer science; State (computer science); Language construct; Formal methods,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3450968 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tosem/tosem30.html#PaulweberSZ21 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3450968,,10.1145/3450968,3184084070,,0,000-987-649-080-323; 002-291-727-672-963; 002-967-883-694-133; 003-131-921-427-332; 004-296-789-760-892; 006-635-819-665-420; 007-381-832-300-53X; 010-852-259-152-365; 011-882-730-843-904; 016-446-377-960-149; 016-788-734-020-674; 018-369-083-778-030; 019-113-402-382-947; 021-155-668-810-504; 021-518-769-824-032; 021-785-921-993-647; 023-186-040-384-436; 023-525-094-334-358; 027-244-737-862-440; 028-157-911-232-198; 029-858-763-538-985; 030-219-725-823-27X; 032-534-780-514-907; 034-400-132-510-675; 034-542-802-471-470; 034-621-810-710-916; 036-805-318-187-317; 038-014-431-396-278; 046-216-399-297-450; 047-682-196-320-651; 051-129-010-190-280; 054-230-259-110-181; 055-042-610-674-194; 055-994-015-424-471; 057-648-310-683-602; 059-490-107-222-814; 059-975-823-275-808; 060-776-050-843-781; 062-147-321-839-065; 062-405-632-629-574; 062-961-043-503-946; 071-180-469-577-920; 073-682-597-789-568; 076-967-105-634-518; 077-754-909-759-890; 078-447-480-862-591; 082-714-949-563-192; 087-758-699-330-180; 099-346-724-924-680; 099-482-594-708-125; 100-162-484-718-18X; 100-712-624-370-474; 105-471-755-947-795; 106-113-148-648-052; 107-818-703-764-113; 113-305-012-062-482; 114-573-855-811-418; 134-048-117-134-427; 142-244-472-246-595; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-040-306-323-729; 151-202-864-876-079; 155-332-127-621-78X; 159-497-134-948-087; 167-303-943-230-544; 167-896-065-369-695; 168-932-299-108-131; 172-572-166-912-802; 181-401-889-710-788; 195-635-564-405-355; 196-789-941-898-801,4,false,,

The method allows one to start system development with a trustworthy high level system specification and to link such a ""ground model"" in a well documented and inspectable way through intermediate design steps to its implementation. The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich's Abstract State Machines. Through its versatility the ASM approach is non-monolithic and integratable at any development level into current design and analysis environments.

Many programming languages allow some non-determinism for evaluating expressions. The semantics only have in common that arguments are evaluated before an operator is applied. The evaluation of one argument may be interleaved with the evaluation of the other arguments. However, programming languages usually restrict this most liberal evaluation order. For example, the expression evaluation may take into account short-circuit evaluation of boolean expressions which implies that right operands must not be evaluated before the complete left operand is evaluated. Our approach provides a generic expression evaluation semantics that only need to be instantiated adequatly. We demonstrate this approach by the example of Ada95, C, C++, Java, C#, and Fortran.",,,391,406,Semantics; Short-circuit evaluation; Abstract state machines; Boolean expression; Semantics (computer science); Programming language; Eager evaluation; Denotational semantics; Rule of inference; Computer science; Operand; Expression (mathematics); Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/21538136 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_23 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_23 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#ZimmermannD03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_23,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_23,1507424848,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 024-520-614-355-958; 034-728-900-389-951; 041-863-663-936-741; 059-553-350-068-285; 067-209-706-756-159; 083-972-922-498-894; 088-012-407-050-722; 105-620-622-527-144; 168-683-312-771-217; 176-077-001-502-714,13,false,,

It consists in generating test sequences from ASM models and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. This process is applied at different models, starting from the more abstract model to the one that is very close to the code. The process consists of the following steps: (1) model the system as an Abstract State Machine, (2) generate test sequences based on the ASM model, (3) compute the code coverage using generated tests, (4) if the coverage is low refine the Abstract State Machine and return to step 2.

Previous research, however, has focused on evolving Boolean functions directly, and not on general methods that are capable of generating the desired functions. The former approach has the advantage of being able to produce a large number of functions in a relatively short time, but it directly depends on the size of the search space. In this paper, we present a method to evolve algebraic constructions for generation of bent Boolean functions. To strengthen our approach, we define three types of constructions and give experimental results for them. Our results show that this approach is able to produce a large number of constructions, which could in turn enable the construction of many more Boolean functions with a larger number of variables.",,,781,788,Maximum satisfiability problem; Discrete mathematics; Boolean circuit; Boolean expression; Boolean function; And-inverter graph; Two-element Boolean algebra; Mathematics; Standard Boolean model; Theoretical computer science; Bent function,,,,"Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost",https://www.bib.irb.hr/829607 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/gecco/gecco2016.html#PicekJ16 https://core.ac.uk/display/80808611 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2908812.2908915 https://doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908915,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908915,,10.1145/2908812.2908915,2505008844,,0,000-304-245-350-205; 011-667-817-097-068; 021-490-149-588-591; 023-962-003-502-930; 024-613-563-583-629; 026-568-582-742-368; 030-946-701-941-192; 032-524-931-612-370; 033-027-137-279-186; 033-451-707-305-773; 037-788-453-907-297; 041-688-091-035-239; 043-867-033-033-696; 052-963-528-767-866; 054-767-714-008-550; 055-884-752-693-164; 062-387-209-729-694; 067-816-282-048-128; 082-586-013-456-492; 085-015-245-207-727; 089-087-838-476-20X; 117-567-852-717-926; 121-731-315-387-702; 122-310-071-776-058; 139-302-406-827-281; 141-907-254-896-256; 143-137-217-162-987; 146-169-054-540-618; 155-370-246-928-132; 170-212-971-613-168; 176-158-112-198-502; 188-651-125-784-29X; 189-070-156-692-866; 192-417-603-253-442,28,false,,

CENELEC 50128 strongly recommends the utilization of finite state machines during system modelling stage and formal proof methods during the verification and testing stages of control algorithms. Due to the high importance of interlocking table at the design state of a signalization system, the modelling and verification of interlocking tables are examined in this work. For this purpose, abstract state machines are used as a modelling tool. The developed models have been performed in a generalized structure such that the model control can be done automatically for the interlocking systems. In this study, NuSMV is used at the verification state. Also, the consistency of the developed models has been supervised through fault injection.

However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g., in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed. We illustrate how the control construct can improve the code's readability on some examples. The proposed control construct is also released as a plugin for CoreASM.",,,37,53,Abstract state machines; Executable; Control flow; Code (cryptography); Programming language; Readability; Construct (python library); Computer science; Plug-in; Syntax,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8_2 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8_2/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-33600-8_2 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/abz2016.html#StegmaierDRT16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8_2,,10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8_2,2501361919,,0,001-175-297-753-696; 004-266-873-563-413; 018-401-999-571-352; 026-476-847-126-74X; 029-763-494-074-083; 034-400-132-510-675; 042-473-266-944-062; 060-733-812-776-088; 083-583-404-269-099; 085-462-946-700-498; 088-497-830-243-220; 132-648-525-845-187; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-019-981-692-623; 151-315-450-477-968; 189-521-689-083-502,0,false,,

These systems often have stringent real-time requirements. This paper presents an extension to AADL's behavior model using time annotations in order to improve the evaluation of timing properties in AADL.

F. Raihan; Mohammad Zulkernine,"Security, one of the most important aspects of software, gets very little attention during the software development life cycle (SDLC). Therefore, the software remains vulnerable to attacks which are handled by issuing patches or service packs by the software vendors. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to take security into consideration right from the very beginning of the software development process. However, most specification languages were not designed with an intention for specifying security requirements, and therefore, they lack some features to serve this purpose. As a result, we need suitable specification languages that can be used both for functional specification and security specification. We propose a formal extension of a popular specification language called AsmL (Abstract State Machine Language) for attack descriptions with a view to building secure software. We name the extended language AsmLSec. We present the details of AsmLSec syntax and semantics, describe how to model attacks using its constructs, and present the design and implementation of a compiler that generates attack signatures from the AsmLSec attack specifications. To evaluate the expressive power of AsmLSec, we model attack scenarios based on the benchmark DARPA data sets",,,775,782,Software requirements specification; Formal specification; Programming language; Specification language; Computer science; Software design; Software development; Functional specification; Software security assurance; Formal methods,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/IEEEares/ares2007.html#RaihanZ07 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4159874/ http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004159874 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4159874 https://doi.org/10.1109/ARES.2007.45 http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ARES.2007.45,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ares.2007.45,,10.1109/ares.2007.45,2150797223,,0,020-040-818-198-765; 049-484-005-083-012; 071-623-497-103-503; 071-754-420-083-591; 075-815-277-884-928; 092-535-009-672-590; 105-620-622-527-144; 128-142-405-176-908; 135-667-336-473-575; 153-852-808-629-003; 194-860-464-010-529,12,false,,

System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a semi-formal hazard analysis method that aims to identify safety requirements emerging from the analysis of potential interactions among components and inadequate control in the system’s design. In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a methodology capturing both the formal representation of ASM with the ability to generate safety properties from the STPA hazard analysis. This has the advantages of verifying the STPA requirements in a formal way, and giving insights for the improvement of the ASM specification, depending on these requirements. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to an insulin pump control system case study, showing what safety issues it highlights.",,,15,32,Software engineering; Formal specification; Abstract state machines; Abstraction layer; Life-critical system; Control system; Hazard analysis; Temporal logic; Control (management); Computer science,Abstract State Machines; System Theoretic Process Analysis; Temporal Logic; Validation and Verification,,,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/abstract-state-machines-and-system-theoretic-process-analysis-for-safetycritical-systems(5457055e-69ef-4d65-90d5-36c40ef7c1b9).html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sbmf/sbmf2017.html#Al-ShareefiLD17 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_3 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3009511/ https://core.ac.uk/display/131169054 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-70848-5_3 https://core.ac.uk/download/131169054.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_3,,10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_3,2768006048,,0,012-145-702-064-547; 019-049-590-624-988; 021-346-180-894-785; 028-149-820-987-827; 029-430-162-022-193; 035-042-035-415-157; 038-467-272-421-692; 040-736-326-793-892; 043-656-153-786-617; 046-725-619-397-441; 046-838-597-306-588; 052-284-021-464-888; 053-879-779-234-065; 067-783-079-818-66X; 082-129-618-635-49X; 085-278-493-726-942; 099-943-874-354-121; 105-620-622-527-144; 113-750-969-333-096; 115-015-459-449-664; 121-369-334-638-387; 139-330-264-873-706; 175-725-863-324-84X; 181-401-889-710-788; 189-521-689-083-502,3,true,,green

We provide a complete embedding of PSL in the ASM language AsmL, which allows us to integrate PSL properties as a part of the design. For verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the code containing both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage of the AsmL language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both C# code and FSMs from AsmL models.

Parallel abstract state machines (parallel ASMs) are such parallel algorithms, and the parallel ASM thesis asserts that every parallel algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to a parallel ASM. In an earlier article, we axiomatized parallel algorithms, proved the ASM thesis, and proved that every parallel ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a parallel algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual parallel models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that parallel ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new parallel components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what parallel algorithms ought to be.

Structural model elements are translated into an ASM vocabulary as collections of domains and functions, whereas the dynamic view is captured by multi-agent ASMs reflecting the behavior modelled by UML state machines. In our toolkit, input UML models can be drawn using any UML CASE Tool able to produce the XMI format for diagrams. This textual representation is employed to initialize the ASM model for state machines which can be symbolically executed by AsmGofer, an advanced Abstract State Machine programming system.

But what is a computation? We try to answer this question without fixing a computation model first. This brings up additional foundational questions like what is a level of abstraction? The analysis leads us to the notion of abstract state machine (ASM) and to the ASM thesis: Let A be any computer system at a fixed level of abstraction. There is an abstract state machine B that step-for-step simulates A.,,,24,24,Abstract state machines; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computation; Abstraction (linguistics); Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ershov/ershov2001.html#Gurevich01 https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45575-2_3 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-45575-2_3 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-45575-2_3 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-45575-2_3.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45575-2_3,,10.1007/3-540-45575-2_3,1491251816,,0,,5,false,,

The availability of high-level data types allow state elements to be represented both abstractly and faithfully at the same time. In this paper we look at symbolic analysis of ASMs. We consider ASMs over a fixed state background T that includes linear arithmetic, sets, tuples, and maps. For symbolic analysis, ASMs are translated into guarded update systems called model programs. We formulate the problem of bounded path exploration of model programs, or the problem of Bounded Model Program Checking (BMPC) as a satisfiability problem modulo T . Then we investigate the boundaries of decidable and undecidable cases for BMPC. In a general setting, BMPC is shown to be highly undecidable (Σ1-complete); and even when restricting to finite sets the problem remains re-hard (Σ1-hard). On the other hand, BMPC is shown to be decidable for a class of basic model programs that are common in practice. We use Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for solving BMPC; an instance of the BMPC problem is mapped to a formula, the formula is satisfiable modulo T if and only if the corresponding BMPC problem instance has a solution. The recent SMT advances allow us to directly analyze specifications using sets and maps with specialized decision procedures for expressive fragments of these theories. Our approach is extensible; background theories need in fact only be partially solved by the SMT solver; we use simulation of ASMs to support additional theories that are beyond the scope of available decision procedures.",3,,149,170,Model checking; Tuple; Decidability; Satisfiability modulo theories; Undecidable problem; Bounded function; Computer science; Symbolic data analysis; Boolean satisfiability problem; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SymbolicBoundedModelCheckingOfAbstractStateMachines.pdf http://www.ijsi.org/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=149&flag=1 https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gurevich/Opera/199.pdf https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/symbolic-bounded-model-checking-of-abstract-state-machines-2/,http://www.ijsi.org/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=149&flag=1,,,2117336825,,0,002-438-766-985-114; 003-572-638-036-17X; 003-702-584-610-342; 004-322-783-807-772; 007-260-994-045-796; 011-067-617-302-064; 012-561-429-329-091; 013-321-617-545-692; 015-323-242-900-556; 015-537-856-335-698; 026-830-714-409-083; 029-858-763-538-985; 029-914-316-585-134; 030-528-452-467-247; 033-029-784-727-159; 040-475-935-409-54X; 040-870-554-998-336; 041-222-830-496-844; 045-765-754-055-719; 046-735-459-925-557; 050-578-715-624-648; 052-786-350-485-495; 057-052-364-771-627; 060-046-569-964-120; 071-763-443-479-85X; 076-267-222-460-45X; 077-445-945-450-939; 082-739-796-462-702; 089-355-190-014-421; 105-610-448-632-635; 106-669-165-984-633; 110-351-089-639-348; 114-280-445-045-344; 130-908-066-858-08X; 157-311-554-599-521; 164-490-126-283-133,15,false,,

125-479-003-125-926,From AADL to Timed Abstract State Machines: A Verified Model Transformation,,2014,journal article,Journal of Systems and Software,01641212,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Zhibin Yang; Kai Hu; Dianfu Ma; Jean-Paul Bodeveix; Lei Pi; Jean-Pierre Talpin,"Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is an architecture description language standard for embedded real-time systems widely used in the avionics and aerospace industry to model safety-critical applications. To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (TTS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose). Finally, the verified transformation is mechanized in the theorem prover Coq.",93,,42,68,Formal specification; Architecture Analysis & Design Language; Abstract state machines; Formal semantics (linguistics); Architecture description language; Programming language; Automated theorem proving; Model transformation; Computer science; Model-driven architecture; Semantics of logic,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121214000727 https://hal-univ-tlse3.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01095002v1 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01123837 https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/12950/ https://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/papers/jss14.pdf https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01123837/file/Yang_12950.pdf https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01095002 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jss/jss93.html#YangHMBPT14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121214000727 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058,,10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.058,1998429448,,0,003-633-926-825-620; 005-283-314-519-468; 007-722-206-280-79X; 008-563-398-463-013; 009-457-671-845-715; 013-352-634-535-287; 014-433-375-269-260; 014-495-099-070-581; 015-754-334-457-277; 016-800-932-078-569; 018-793-561-283-562; 023-147-244-284-961; 025-897-991-209-485; 026-929-059-967-491; 032-262-646-526-45X; 032-476-271-556-356; 035-094-069-556-454; 035-518-394-425-446; 037-238-696-268-040; 038-139-157-695-265; 038-467-272-421-692; 039-853-548-305-791; 040-511-014-314-218; 043-160-022-814-818; 043-254-184-800-221; 043-684-320-465-000; 049-444-444-426-228; 052-957-621-282-424; 058-413-068-536-224; 059-903-469-081-37X; 060-733-812-776-088; 071-149-299-918-212; 072-659-327-044-492; 073-401-141-051-596; 073-701-725-366-908; 074-293-491-869-778; 075-317-537-213-441; 076-025-489-404-797; 078-912-916-949-104; 080-519-810-884-77X; 084-076-850-832-304; 098-519-421-099-085; 100-124-647-117-913; 100-681-356-295-56X; 103-979-961-534-144; 105-597-299-698-871; 106-449-039-568-159; 107-820-588-500-413; 107-890-932-297-180; 107-951-376-782-623; 109-533-517-419-694; 111-730-611-795-21X; 113-088-227-467-286; 114-723-268-888-518; 115-015-459-449-664; 116-296-327-783-257; 117-091-257-764-348; 120-878-624-757-199; 121-190-479-708-008; 122-845-661-963-17X; 123-441-945-469-160; 124-614-374-692-64X; 132-920-378-615-866; 133-813-232-822-224; 135-695-271-107-707; 140-294-050-741-177; 150-745-487-219-94X; 153-921-497-662-290; 168-484-158-939-306; 180-237-590-940-45X; 189-075-692-747-915; 191-133-493-945-948,50,true,,green

Turbo ASM–theory and ALGOL60 have two central phenomena in common: Operational style of specifying and semantics definition and named rules and procedures with their potential of recursion.

For this the notion of service mediator has been coined, which captures specifications of composed services with slots that have to be filled by actual services. Such mediators can be specified by expressions in Kleene algebras with tests (KATs) or equivalently by very restricted Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this paper we address the refinement of such specifications with the intention to capture more meaningful conditions on the service slots and to fine-tune the matching of the slots with actual services. In particular, we investigate refinements that express user preferences thus leading to personalised mediators. For this form of adaptivity a previously developed term rewriting approach on KATs is generalised to refinements on ASMs.",,,158,166,Abstract state machines; Rewriting; Personalization; Programming language; Term (logic); Service (business); Web service; Computer science; Service-oriented architecture; Theoretical computer science; Server,,,,,https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/72055 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/qsic/qsic2012.html#ScheweW12 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006319242 https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/72055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/qsic.2012.22,,10.1109/qsic.2012.22,1996539518,,0,008-374-356-717-545; 014-052-786-609-742; 020-859-000-477-739; 022-174-461-059-506; 035-172-473-573-484; 038-183-499-570-436; 044-919-390-468-397; 049-295-402-440-578; 051-307-262-996-060; 056-203-813-457-879; 057-174-043-300-23X; 057-911-406-606-64X; 072-373-364-811-861; 130-471-786-820-195; 139-330-264-873-706; 166-334-409-461-321; 173-502-846-620-11X; 177-858-991-819-515; 195-483-051-287-365,1,false,,

Along the example of the FLASH cache coherence protocol, we show how model checking can support development and debugging of ASM models.

The UML metamodel consists of informal description, class diagrams which are used to give the abstract syntax, and the well-formedness rules given in OCL. Furthermore, class diagrams have played an important role in software development because they provide basic information about a software system. In this paper, we propose a new method to support class diagrams based on Abstract State Machines. As an application of this method we will use a class diagram to represent OCL structure and therefore an OCL translator is generated. Based on the support of class diagrams and OCL, any user-defined UML model (M1-level), as an instantiation of the UML metamodel, can be compared against the UML metamodel. On the other hand, an object model (M0-level) can be checked based on the user-defined UML model (M1-level). Therefore, more errors can be reported to software developers during the early phase of software development.",,,100,105,Model checking; Abstract syntax; Abstract state machines; Unified Modeling Language; Software system; Programming language; Class diagram; Abstraction model checking; Computer science; Software development,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iastedSE/se2005.html#ShenL05,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iastedSE/se2005.html#ShenL05,,,28331999,,0,045-595-823-762-363; 082-714-949-563-192; 090-876-580-086-374; 096-005-773-435-141; 105-620-622-527-144; 109-552-559-143-618; 128-443-654-075-760,5,false,,

They consist of a large-number of sensors, processing centers and services deployed in a wide geographical area. Due to their complexity and heterogeneity, such systems face a high-level of uncertainty and the failure of one node can affect the availability of the whole solution. Monitoring services collect data about the state of components and elaborate a diagnosis, aiming to increase the reliability of the system. This paper proposes an Abstract State Machine model to capture the properties and behavior of monitoring services addressing system failures. The method encompasses the translation of the requirements of the system to ground models. We discuss the formal solution with respect to the problem domain and execute a simulation of the model. We discuss the suitability of the method for distributed systems and compare it with other modeling approaches.",,,483,490,,Formal Modeling; Abstract State Machines; Large-Scale Distributed Systems; Monitoring; Smart City,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0006303704830490,,10.5220/0006303704830490,,,0,,4,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

Unlike other logics for ASMs which are based on dynamic logic, our logic is based on an atomic predicate for function updates and on a definedness predicate for the termination of the evaluation of transition rules. We do not assume that the transition rules of ASMs are in normal form, for example, that they concern distinct cases. Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. We show that several axioms that have been proposed for reasoning about ASMs are derivable in our system. We provide also an extension of the logic with explicit step information which allows to eliminate modal operators in certain cases. The main technical result is that the logic is complete for hierarchical (non-recursive) ASMs. We show that, for hierarchical ASMs, the logic is a definitional extension of first-order predicate logic.",,,,,Computer science; State (computer science); Programming language,Abstract State Machines; dynamic logic; modal logic; logical foundations of specification languages.

Because of undecidability in the general case, one has to identify classes of ASMs and classes of properties in order to receive positive decidability results. One idea for this could be to put simple restrictions on the ASMs as forbidding certain advanced constructs. But it turns out that this does not help much. Additionally, the restrictions in those cases are very strong. Consequently, one has to look for others. Such restrictions may result from techniques which are intended to be used in the proofs of decidability. One proof technique is the reduction to a decidable reasoning problem in logic. In [8] and [10], this has been applied to receive some positive decidability results.; ; In this paper, we identify further classes of ASMs and classes of properties for which the general verification problem is decidable. Each proof is a reduction to the satisfiability problem of a fragment of linear temporal first-order logic which has respectively been proved to be decidable in [6] or [7].",,,341,355,First-order logic; Mathematical proof; Reduction (recursion theory); Discrete mathematics; Algebra; Abstract state machines; Decidability; Atomic formula; Temporal logic; Fragment (logic); Linear logic; Computer science; Computation; Linear temporal logic; Boolean satisfiability problem; Abstract machine,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#Nowack03 https://core.ac.uk/display/36491917 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_20,1481826604,,0,006-558-580-892-106; 009-890-670-252-077; 013-134-288-375-43X; 025-803-420-641-004; 048-523-071-082-504; 052-995-531-322-274; 073-967-282-449-373; 079-932-533-401-672; 083-972-922-498-894; 086-223-977-202-166; 122-032-762-876-288; 157-108-282-805-526; 181-494-707-803-365,7,false,,

Mutation testing can be applied at different levels of abstraction, e.g., the unit level, the integration level, and the specification level. Designing mutation operators represents the cornerstone towards conducting effective mutation testing and analysis. While mutation operators are well defined for a number of programming and specification languages, to the best of our knowledge, mutation operators have not been defined for the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism. In this paper, we define and classify mutation operators for the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism. The proposed ASM mutation operators are illustrated using examples written in the CoreASM language.

The role of a robust monitoring framework is to gather low-level data and assess the status of the components of the system. The framework collaborates with adapters for ensuring steady recovery plans and improving the availability of services. Monitors, as part of the system, are also affected by unavailability or random failures. In order to increase the reliability of the solution we verify the trustworthiness of the monitors and emphasize the need of redundancy. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying a monitoring solution for Large-Scale Distributed Systems. We formalize the behavior of the monitors with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model.

Techniques to assure the quality of these applications are thus needed in order to identify in advance possible faults. Model-driven approaches to the testing of Web Applications can provide developers with a way of checking the conformance of the actual Web Application with respect to the model built from the requirements. These approaches can be used to automatically generate from the model a set of test cases satisfying certain coverage criteria, and thus can be integrated in a classical test driven development process. In this paper we present an automated technique for Web Application testing using a model-driven approach. We present a way of modeling Web Applications by Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and a process for generating automatically from the model a concrete test suite that is executed on the Web Application under test in order to check the conformance between the application and the model.",7703,,71,78,Software engineering; Web application; Distributed computing; Test case; Web modeling; Abstract state machines; Test suite; Unavailability; Computer science; Web testing; Test-driven development,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35623-0_7.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icwe/icwe2012w.html#BolisGGMM12 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7 https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/28172 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7,,10.1007/978-3-642-35623-0_7,166851811,,0,000-212-842-536-499; 004-165-410-572-804; 006-244-045-917-365; 007-111-583-746-548; 014-875-365-850-914; 018-408-105-437-771; 021-003-498-716-896; 024-774-638-733-220; 046-412-114-937-61X; 046-838-597-306-588; 047-299-736-589-511; 054-890-739-713-647; 082-093-993-781-083; 121-949-861-550-29X; 139-330-264-873-706; 147-436-309-880-519; 170-042-235-963-558; 189-521-689-083-502,11,true,,green

A novel feature for ASM based languages is symbolic execution, which we briefly describe. CASM is used for instruction set simulator generation and for semantic description in a compiler verification project. We report on the experience of using the language in those two projects.

Benczúr; Uwe Glässer; Tamás Lukovszki,"We define here a distributed abstract state machine (DASM) [7] of the network or routing layer of mobile ad hoc networks [13]. Such networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks, since storing and updating large routing tables at mobile hosts would congest the network with administration packets very fast. In [1], the hypercubic location service is presented, which considers a very strong definition of fault-tolerance thereby improving state-of-the-art ad hoc routing protocols in several respects. Our goal in modeling the protocols for the distributed location service and the position based routing is twofold. First, we support the definition and validation of wireless communication protocols and implementations based thereon. Second, we feel that the abstract computation model naturally reflects the layering principle of communication architectures in combination with an uncompromisingly local view of the application domain. Thus we can identify fundamental semantic concepts, such as concurrency, reactivity and asynchronism, directly with the related concepts as imposed by the given application context.",,,204,217,Geocast; Distributed computing; Network packet; Routing table; Ad hoc wireless distribution service; Telecommunications network; Vehicular ad hoc network; Policy-based routing; Optimized Link State Routing Protocol; Static routing; Triangular routing; Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing; Computer network; Adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing; Computer science; Wireless Routing Protocol; Geographic routing; Wireless; Link-state routing protocol; Mobile ad hoc network; Wireless ad hoc network; Routing domain; Dynamic Source Routing,,,,,https://www.cs.sfu.ca/research/groups/NML/archive/pdf00004.pdf http://www.cs.sfu.ca/research/groups/NML/archive/pdf00004.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_11 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36498-6_11.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/48286111 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_11 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2003.html#BenczurGL03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36498-6_11,,10.1007/3-540-36498-6_11,2129864673,,1,000-881-650-594-297; 002-704-891-527-779; 002-769-042-468-038; 006-555-745-475-703; 013-303-721-674-938; 032-004-847-886-839; 041-818-651-767-693; 052-232-984-034-384; 053-462-578-428-61X; 079-723-355-085-863; 086-911-802-907-518; 089-303-895-062-146; 090-234-039-298-77X; 092-895-055-652-290; 105-620-622-527-144; 111-472-453-337-520; 114-415-758-403-670; 151-388-547-139-938; 154-242-126-987-493; 154-916-490-571-433; 158-998-382-961-239; 162-008-052-602-531,9,true,,green

In this paper, we propose the integration of two multiagent modeling paradigms, abstract state machines and interpreted systems, to develop a comprehensive framework for computational situation analysis (SA) as a basis for design and development of decision support systems. Due to the similarities of the underlying modeling concepts, a systematic integration of the two paradigms seems sensible, as each one has its particular focus and strength, complementing each other in several respects. Our approach builds on multiagent systems theories to formalize the distributed aspect, allows for reasoning about knowledge, uncertainty and belief change, and enables rapid prototyping of abstract executable decision support system models.",,,1,8,Decision support system; Abstract state machines; Situation analysis; Traceability; Executable; Finite-state machine; Computer science; Multi-agent system; Management science; Intelligent decision support system,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632397/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fusion/fusion2008.html#FarahbodGBG08 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632397/ https://isif.org/fusion/proceedings/fusion08CD/papers/1569108407.pdf,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fusion/fusion2008.html#FarahbodGBG08,,,1608057897,,0,005-919-900-156-170; 006-244-045-917-365; 006-555-745-475-703; 016-799-163-937-887; 019-911-894-187-65X; 022-955-585-690-019; 027-765-297-864-912; 033-755-505-178-625; 034-400-132-510-675; 045-374-277-640-529; 060-776-050-843-781; 065-449-874-396-56X; 076-073-572-022-016; 080-150-543-870-121; 087-857-802-922-971; 092-195-924-604-606; 095-581-760-613-083; 105-620-622-527-144; 109-847-160-864-681; 118-448-708-624-818; 147-982-445-249-738; 176-889-161-409-600,9,false,,

Models typically allow an implementation freedom for a range of behavior. ASMs use two concepts to achieve this. Parallel composition abstracts from irrelevant sequentiality. Nondeterministic choice abstracts from irrelevant algorithmic detail. As a thought experiment, we wish to see the consequences of substituting parallel composition by nondeterministic composition. We have found that it provides some alternative benefits, e.g. the complex theory of partial updates wouldn’t be necessary, since successsive updates take care of combining the effect of partial updates. ASMs of different abstraction levels could be reused, since updates on different abstraction levels wouldn’t collide. It would be consistent with the current mechanism for exception handling in Microsoft’s ASM language. Finally, we also show that this change in semantics does not destroy the spirit of ASMs, in fact most ASM models wouldn’t need any change at all. We have not analyzed the consequences of using nondeterminstic composition for the ASM thesis, but for a specification language nondeterminstic composition seems to work fine.

Parlay/OSA [4] specification covers different aspects: messaging, location, conferencing, security, call-control, etc.Our work focuses on the Call Control API specification whose main goal is both to allow applications creating whichever kind of call between voice terminals connected to different networks, and also react to call requests coming from various networks, according to the service-logic implemented by the applications (e.g. [3]).The Parlay documentation provides a specification of the Call Control Service Capability Feature (SCF) aspects of the interface by means of UML [5] class, state, and sequence diagrams. However, although UML emerges as the best practice modeling notation for object-oriented software development, in its current setting it still lacks of a formal semantics. As a consequence its usage and, correspondingly, the interpretation of developed models may differ considerably. For this reason several of semantics models for UML diagrams have been provided (see for instance [1]).

Together, they form a powerful tool for checking systems. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a competitive model checking approach due to its ability to compactly encode BMC problems. In this paper, we present a method of applying ASP to BMC of ASMs. Given an ASM and a temporal property, we show how to efficiently translate the BMC problem for the ASM into a problem of answer set computation.

We define refinements following the semantical framework of observability, however, with respect to chosen pieces of the program. The time we consider is continuous as our motivation is related to systems of control that are usually specified within continuous time framework; the same framework is valid for discrete time. We remark that refinement of timed programs is not a simple replacement of a part of a program by making it more detailed. As an example to illustrate this we take Lamport's Bakery Algorithm with real-time constraints. However, one of the key questions related to the verification of refinements is the preservation of verification proofs for the non refined initial algorithm as much as possible when verifying the refinement. This is the case for the notion of refinement we define. We introduce a notion of asynchronous timed distributed algorithm, define its semantics and discuss in what logic can be expressed its functioning. Then we introduce notions of refinement, and consider a refinement of interprocess communication of real-time Lamport's Bakery algorithm using parallel message exchange. Such a refinement, contrary to our intuition, demands some non evident transformation of the initial algorithm to make it correct.",,,34,49,Mathematical proof; Distributed algorithm; Abstract state machines; Asynchronous communication; Programming language; Inter-process communication; Observability; Computer science; Lamport's bakery algorithm; Theoretical computer science; Abstract machine; Refinement calculus,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2000.html#CohenS00 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4,,10.1007/3-540-44518-8_4,1524432022,,0,002-806-387-188-795; 008-168-001-665-128; 018-689-712-347-616; 067-042-828-672-760; 073-967-282-449-373; 075-180-208-062-182; 164-825-489-208-505; 179-537-609-486-445,4,false,,

We take the abstract state machine (ASM) as operation semantics for formalising communication model when using IaaS platform services, which can show the changes of dynamic performance about the platform status. Meanwhile, we simplify the model without sacrificing the service correctness from user's perspective.

199-393-797-024-189,Abstract State Machines - Time in State Machines.,,2005,book,,,,,Susanne Graf; Andreas Prinz,"State machines are a very general means to express computations in an implementationindependent way. There are ways to extend the abstract state machine (ASM) framework with distribution aspects, but there is no unifying framework for handling time so far.; ; We propose event structures extended with time as a natural framework for representing state machines and their true concurrency model at a semantic level and for discussing associated time models. Constraints on these timed event structures and their traces (runs) are then used for characterising different frameworks for timed computations. This characterisation of timed frameworks is independent of ASM and allows to compare time models of different modelling formalisms.; ; Finally, we propose some specific extensions of ASM for the expressions of time constraints in accordance with the event-based semantic framework and show the applicability of the obtained framework on an example with a standard time model and a set of consistency properties for timed computations.",,,217,232,Moore machine; Abstract state machines; State transition table; State diagram; Finite-state machine; Mealy machine; Extended finite-state machine; Concurrency; Computer science; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#GrafP05 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#GrafP05 http://www.univ-paris12.fr/lacl/dima/asm05/GrafPrinzASM2005-pgnb.pdf,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asm/asm2005.html#GrafP05,,,1525455244,,0,000-490-410-327-490; 006-135-647-549-712; 006-555-745-475-703; 006-944-801-372-573; 008-168-001-665-128; 022-955-585-690-019; 025-514-448-365-880; 025-811-569-298-195; 027-765-297-864-912; 035-472-280-060-118; 037-445-945-364-220; 043-700-504-601-350; 055-936-391-993-277; 063-340-995-862-940; 064-740-359-461-707; 075-476-492-575-112; 105-620-622-527-144; 141-021-198-935-755; 189-521-689-083-502,2,false,,
