The different ways in which a system can operate are associated with different modes, and transitions link modes to form mode-machines. However, mode-machines need a precise semantics if they are to be used for specifying the behaviour of critical systems. This paper analyses the possible relationships between modes and states. A number of concurrent systems described using MASCOT are considered, and their mode-based behaviour is used to motivate the semantics of a new real-time mode-machine notation, RTMMs. It is argued that PITE/fMs should not behave like abstract state-machines, A list of concurrent transactions is associated with each RTMM mode, rand a notation is given for specifying their timing properties. RTMM transactions need not terminate when the central mode-controller switches mode, thus capturing the asynchronous way in which large systems respond to mode changes.

Apart from the usual language maintenance, SDL-2000 will offer new features for exception handling and object-oriented data types. To capture these features formally, a new formal SDL semantics is being devised. In several meetings of ITU-T SG10/Q6, the essential design objectives have been clarified, and an outline of the behaviour model for SDL has been presented and discussed. A major concern in this discussion has been the demand for an executable model, which calls for an operational formalism with readily available tool support. Subsequent investigations have shown that Abstract State Machines (ASMs) meet this and all other design objectives, and therefore have been chosen as the underlying formalism. In this paper, ASMs are applied to define the behaviour model of a sample SDL specification formally, thereby illustrating the approach in general.","Paderborn Univ, Heinz Nixdorf INst, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-33102 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Glässer, U (corresponding author), Paderborn Univ, Heinz Nixdorf INst, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-33102 Paderborn, Germany.",,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,0-444-50228-9,,,,1999,,,,,,,171,190,,10.1016/B978-044450228-5/50013-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-044450228-5/50013-8,,,20,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BN91G,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000083441800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Is there a computation model whose machines do not distinguish between isomorphic structures and compute exactly PTime properties? This question can be recast as follows: Does there exist a logic that captures polynomial time (without presuming the presence of a linear order)? Earlier, one of us conjectured a negative answer. The problem motivated a quest for stronger and stronger PTime logics. All these logics avoid arbitrary choice. Here we attempt to capture the choiceless fragment of PTime. Our computation model is a version of abstract state machines (formerly called evolving algebras). The idea is to replace arbitrary choice with parallel execution. The resulting logic expresses all properties expressible in any other PTime logic in the literature. A more difficult theorem shows that the logic does not capture all of PTime.

In this paper we propose a simple but powerful way to construct a reduced abstract transition system derived from the original ASM by using only the transition relations of the so-called property dependent state variables VP of the property P to be verified. It is easy to be shown that the abstract system so constructed strongly preserves P, and consequently the abstract system constructed using only a subset of VP weakly preserves P. The critical thing is how to select the subset of VP. We present here a heuristic iterative reduction algorithm for verifying the properties. At each iteration step, we trace further the property dependency graph and add a noncorelated set of state variables to the current set of state variables to construct a more detailed model. The algorithm can handle with both abstract and concrete state variables. It is completely automatic and succeeds in reducing the model and verifying properties where other tools fail.","Univ Montreal, Dept IRO, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Hou, J (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept IRO, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",,,,,,,,5,2,3,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1063-0988,,0-7803-6598-4,P IEEE INT ASIC C&E,,,2000,,,,,,,347,351,,10.1109/ASIC.2000.880762,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASIC.2000.880762,,,5,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BQ99K,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000165305200065,View Full Record in Web of Science

Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. We show that several axioms that have been proposed for reasoning about ASMs are derivable in our system. We provide also an extension of the logic with explicit step information which allows to eliminate modal operators in certain cases.

There has been a trend over the last decade towards implementations based on multiprocessor distributed concurrent systems with software components allocated to processors. Designing the system-wide operation, synchronisation and exception handling for such a complex system becomes impossible at the level of traditional process synchronisation primitives, as it becomes intellectually unmanageable to grasp the system-wide behaviour when tackled piecemeal and `bottom up'. An alternative top down approach to structuring and designing the overall behaviour of highly concurrent systems implemented using components is presented. It is based on using one or more simple abstract state machines to define the system-wide synchronisation required in terms of the desired system-level behaviour rather than in terms of the low-level synchronisation primitives chosen for the fine grain of the implementation solution. A practical example involving the creation of a high availability processing system made up of several commercial quality computers is used to illustrate the concept.","Robinson Associates, Painswick GL6 6QG, Glos, England",,"Kirk, B (corresponding author), Robinson Associates, Red Lion House,St Marys St, Painswick GL6 6QG, Glos, England.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,,3-540-67958-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2001,1897,,,,,,197,210,,,,,,14,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,BT95J,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000174580400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

In some sense, objects with integer dimension are partial cases of the more general realm of entities having a ragged shape and fractional dimension. Fractals of a broad class are described by deterministic iterated function systems (IFSs). Simultaneously, the iterated function systems give a base for 'automata networks' capable to realize their latent dynamics. When such a dynamics become alive (with the help of an appropriate automata network), it finishes in a steady state which is (in the general case) a fractal set. In this report, an algorithm is described for building an automata network for a given iterated function system. It is worth noting that the automata networks' can be considered generalizations of cellular automata, the main difference is that our automata networks have non-regular structure of the system of the cell neighborhoods.

Element concepts capture the basic functions of a DSL, and complement concepts define some auxiliary functions for a DSL. Because extended attribute grammar and evolving algebra are used to specify the semantics of element concepts, the descriptions are formal, yet easily understood. Transformation rules are used to specify the semantics of complement concepts. In order to improve the reusability, element and complement concepts are defined at a high abstract level, and they are defined as some independent components. The definition of a new DSL follows two steps: defining element and complement concepts separately; instantiating concepts and assembling them.

Our goal is to try to find a framework that is based on applied first order logic that permits to represent the verification problem directly, completely and conservatively (as explained in Introduction), and that is apt to describe interesting decidable classes, maybe showing way to feasible algorithms. To achieve this goal we use a first order timed logic that is an extension of a decidable theory of reals with timed functions. This logic permits, on the one hand, to rewrite directly and completely requirements and, on the other hand, to describe executions of various timed algorithms-here we consider block Gurevich abstract state machines because of their theoretical clarity and sufficient expressive power. Then we describe one decidable class of the verification problem that is based on notions reflecting finiteness properties of systems of control. These notions may be of independent interest, as, in particular, they give a way to describe a limited usage of arithmetics preserving decidability that is not covered by existing model-theoretic approaches.

One idea for this could be to put simple restrictions on the ASMs as forbidding certain advanced constructs. But it turns out that this does not help much. Additionally, the restrictions in those cases are very strong. Consequently, one has to look for others. Such restrictions may result from techniques which are intended to be used in the proofs of decidability. One proof technique is the reduction to a decidable reasoning problem in logic. In [8] and [10], this has been applied to receive some positive decidability results. In this paper, we identify further classes of ASMs and classes of properties for which the general verification problem is decidable.

Every memory model strikes some balance between strictness (simplifying program behavior) and laxness (permitting greater optimization). With its emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, the Java programming language needs a memory model that is satisfactory to language users and implementors. Everyone in the Java community must be able to understand the Java memory model and its ramifications. The description of the original Java memory model suffered from ambiguity and opaqueness, and attempts to interpret it revealed serious deficiencies. Two memory models have been proposed as replacements. Unfortunately, these two new models are described at different levels of abstraction and are represented in different formats, making it difficult to compare them.

In November 2000, the formal semantics of SDL- 2000 was officially approved to become part of the SDL language definition. It covers both the static and the dynamic semantics, and is based on the formalism of abstract state machines (ASMs). To support executability, the formal semantics defines, for each SDL specification, reference ASM code, which enables an SDL-to-ASM-compiler. In this paper, we briefly survey and compare existing approaches to define the semantics of SDL formally. The ITUT approach is then outlined in more detail, addressing the following steps: (1) mapping of non-basic language constructs to the core language, (2) checking of static semantics conditions, (3) definition of the SDL abstract machine (SAM), and (4) definition of the SDL virtual machine (SVM). The paper concludes with experiences from the SDL-to-ASM-compiler project. It is proposed that the SDL-2000 semantics can be adapted and extended to formally define the meaning of UML 2.0 class, composite structure, and statechart diagrams. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we show how to formalize our liveness-enriched sequence diagrams using Abstract State Machines. Sequence diagrams still have several open problems. For example, the semantics of some of the newly introduced operators is ambiguous, and it is not clear how they can be used or combined with other operators. We address some of these issues in the paper. Finally, a further advantage of using ASMs as a semantic model concerns synthesis. It is our ultimate goal to be able to synthesise automatically a state-based object system from our richer sequence diagrams.

In spite of the fact that a minimal slice is not computable in the general case, we identify an expressive class of ASMs for which a minimal (static) slice is computable (and prove the computability).

According to the ISILEIT design methodology a system is specified and modelled using an integrative specification language that combines modeling concepts taken from two different specification languages, namely the UML and the SDL languages. However, supporting formal verification for such a heterogeneous language implies requirements on formal unification and semantic integration of the adopted modeling concepts. In our approach the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism represents the formal platform for the unification and semantic integration. We show how the ASMs, in particular the AsmL language, have been successfully applied for creating a rigorous unified semantic model that integrates the semantics of UML State Machines, SDL Block Diagrams and Story Diagrams which form the core of the integrative specification language used in ISILEIT. Besides the integration purpose, the ASMs serve as a basis for the application of model checking techniques. Therefore, the rest of the paper presents the work on adoption of state-of-the-art model checking techniques in order to support model checking of the ASM (AsmL) models.","Heinz Nixdorf Inst, D-33102 Paderborn, Germany",,"Kardos, M (corresponding author), Heinz Nixdorf Inst, Fuerstenallee 11, D-33102 Paderborn, Germany.",kardos@uni-paderborn.de; franz@uni-paderborn.de,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,3-540-23135-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2004,3147,,,,,,451,473,,,,,,23,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,BBE25,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000225113800025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we present a realistic but high-level communication model where abstract communicators represent various nets and subnets. The model was originally developed in the process of specifying a particular network architecture, namely, the Universal Plug and Play architecture. But, it is general. Our contention is that every message-based distributed system, properly abstracted, gives rise to a specialization of our abstract communication model. The purpose of the abstract communication model is not to design a new kind of network; rather, it is to discover the common part of all message-based communication networks. The generality of the model has been confirmed by its successful reuse for very different distributed architectures. The model is based on distributed abstract state machines.

The ASM model is used to generate an FSM of the design including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on-the-fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be re-used to validate the design at lower levels through simulation.

UCM models allow the description of functional requirements and high-level designs at early stages of the development process. Recognizing the importance of having a well defined semantic, we propose, in this paper, a concise and rigorous formal semantics for Use Case Maps (UCM). The proposed formal semantics addresses UCM's operational semantics and covers the key language functional constructs. These semantics are defined in terms of Multi-Agent Abstract State Machines that describes how UCM specifications are executed and eliminates ambiguities hidden in the informal language definition. The resulting operational semantics are embedded in an ASM-UCM simulation engine and are expressed in AsmL, an advanced ASM-based executable specification language. The proposed ASM-UCM engine provides an environment for executing and simulating UCM specifications.

A very useful type of model in computing is an abstract state machine which describes transitions over first order structures. The general purpose model-based testing tool SpecExplorer (used within Microsoft, also available externally) uses such a model, written in AsmL or Spec#, to perform a search that checks that all reachable states of the model are safe, and also to check conformance of an arbitrary. NET implementation to the model. Spec Explorer provides a variety of ways to cut down the state space of the model, for instance by finitizing parameter domains or by providing predicate abstraction. It has already found subtle bugs in production software. First order structures and abstract state machines over them are also a useful way to think about cryptographic protocols, since models formulated in these terms arise by natural abstraction from computational cryptography. In this paper we explain this abstraction process, 'experiments as structures', and argue for its faithfulness. We show how the Dolev-Yao intruder model fits into SpecExplorer. In a word, the actions of the Dolev-Yao intruder are the 'controllable' actions of the testing framework, whereas the actions of protocol participants are the 'observable' actions of the model.

In conjunction with the chosen routing strategy, we propose a distributed logical topology based location service (LTLS) protocol and give a formal description and analysis of this protocol on the DASM model. The high dynamics of mobile ad hoc networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks. A strategy for such networks is geographic routing in which each network node can find its physical location via GPS or other navigation technologies. To send a packet, the sender needs to know the most recent physical location of the destination node. This location information is provided by a location service protocol. The LTLS protocol has short message delivery delay, requires small routing tables, uses relatively few administrative packets, and has very good fault tolerance properties. Our goal in defining the network layer protocol in terms of a DASM model is twofold. First, we feel that the mathematical modeling paradigm of distributed abstract state machines provides an ideal formal basis for constructing, analyzing, and validating abstract requirements specifications of mobile ad hoc network protocols. Second, we intend to utilize the resulting behavior model as a formal basis for developing executable specifications serving as a platform for experimental validation of key system attributes and exploration of alternative design choices.

The formalization was based on transition systems and verification conditions were expressed in Dynamic Logic. In this paper, the relation between ASM refinement and data refinement is explored. Data refinement expresses operations and verification conditions using relational calculus. We show how to bridge the gap between the different notations, and that forward simulation in the behavioral approach to data refinement can be viewed as a specific instance of ASM refinement with 1: 1 diagrams, where control structure is not refined. We also prove that two recent generalizations of data refinement, weak refinement and coupled refinement can be derived from ASM refinement. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present an approach to design and verify SystemC models at the transaction level. We integrate the verification as part of the design flow where we first model both the design and the properties (written in Property Specification language) in Unifed Modeling Language (UML); then, we translate them into an intermediate format modeled with AsmL [language based on Abstract State Machines (ASM)]. The AsmL model is used to generate a finite state machine of the design, including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on the fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be reused to validate the design at lower levels by simulation. For existing SystemC designs, we propose to translate the code back to AsmL in order to apply the same verification approach.

This approach allows an easy integration of created specification of developed middleware with existing components of grid systems. The important advantage of this approach is an automatic generation of test procedures for the implementation, following the model-based testing approach. This allows a smooth transition from the specification to implementation stage, as well as investigation of features of specification and implementation, at every stage of their development. Also, we propose a software environment which implements the proposed approach.

Data Warehouses and OLAP systems are a promising area for the application of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this article a layered ground model specification for data warehouses and OLAP system is presented that is based explicitly on the fundamental idea of separating input from operational databases from output to OLAP systems. On this basis we start defining formal refinement rules for such systems. As these refinement rules are formally correct they enable a formal method for the high-quality design of data warehouses and OLAP systems that can be applied without knowing mathematical details of the ASM formalism. Furthermore, we discuss pragmatic guidelines for the application of such rules. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives.

TLM allows designers to focus on functionality while abstracting implementation details. At the register transfer level (RTL), however, different modules communicate through detailed pin level signaling. SoC design methodologies involve the integration of different intellectual property (IP) blocks modeled at different levels of abstraction. Therefore a special module or channel is needed in order to link modules, IN, designed at different abstraction levels. This module, called transactor, can be modeled using a finite state machine (FSM) providing a functional specification of the protocol's behavior. In this paper, we propose a methodology to specify transactors using graphical finite state machine (FSM).

Constraints on these timed event structures and their traces (runs) are then used for characterising different frameworks for timed computations. This characterisation of timed frameworks is independent of ASM and allows to compare time models of different modelling formalisms.

We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage of the AsmL language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both C# code and FSMs from AsmL models. We applied our approach on the PCI-X bus standard, which AsmL model was constructed from the informal standard specifications and a subsequent UML model.

Parallel abstract state machines (parallel ASMs) are such parallel algorithms, and the parallel ASM thesis asserts that every parallel algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to a parallel ASM. In an earlier article, we axiomatized parallel algorithms, proved the ASM thesis, and proved that every parallel ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a parallel algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual parallel models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that parallel ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new parallel components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what parallel algorithms ought to be. We prove the parallel thesis for the new, corrected notion of parallel algorithms, and we check that parallel ASMs satisfy the new axioms.","[Blass, Andreas] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gurevich, Yuri] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Microsoft,"Blass, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ablass@umich.edu; gurevich@microsoft.com,,,,,,,5,14,14,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",1529-3785,,,ACM T COMPUT LOG,ACM Trans.

The rendezvous problem is unsolvable in the class of arbitrary connected graphs, as witnessed by the example of the cycle. Hence we restrict attention to rendezvous in trees, where rendezvous is feasible if and only if the initial positions of the agents are not symmetric. We prove that the minimum memory size guaranteeing rendezvous in all trees of size at most n is e(log n) bits. The upper bound is provided by an algorithm for abstract state machines accomplishing rendezvous in all trees, and using Theta(log n) bits of memory in trees of size at most n. The lower bound is a consequence of the need to distinguish between up to n - 1 links incident to a node. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we focus on the potential existence of pairs of finite agents (i.e., finite automata) capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees.

In the engineering of embedded real-time systems, the correctness of the system is defined in terms of three aspects - function, time, and resource consumption. The goal of the TASM language and its associated toolset is to provide a basis for specification-based real-time system engineering where these three aspects can be specified and analyzed. The TASM language is built on top of Abstract State Machines (ASM) by including facilities for compact and legible specification of non-functional behavior, namely time and resource consumption. The TASM language provides a notation which is well-suited to the specification needs of embedded real-time systems. We begin the presentation of the language with a historical survey on the use of ASM in specifying real-time systems. The core difference between the TASM language and ASM is that steps are inherently durative instead of being instantaneous and steps consume resources. These concepts capture the reality of physical systems in a flexible abstract model. We present the syntax and semantics of the language and illustrate the concepts using an extended version of the production cell case study.","[Ouimet, Martin; Lundqvist, Kristina] MIT, Embedded Syst Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ouimet, M (corresponding author), MIT, Embedded Syst Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mouimet@mit.edu; kristina@mit.edu,,,,,,,27,7,9,0,0,"GRAZ UNIV TECHNOLGOY, INST INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPUTER MEDIA-IICM",GRAZ,"INFFELDGASSE 16C, GRAZ, A-8010, AUSTRIA",0948-695X,,,J UNIVERS COMPUT SCI,J.

A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the everything is a model principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or WebML. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We point out the limitations of the current WSMO model and propose a faithful extension that is based on Concurrent Transaction Logic (CTR).

To express models we propose an executable, object-oriented Architecture Specification Language with rich data types and a well-defined formal semantics, based initially on Microsoft's AsmL. We describe an experimental framework for direct symbolic execution of models in this language, intended as a basis for both property and refinement verification, as well as design exploration. We explain and illustrate our approach through a case study, the modelling a simple mu op scheduler and its refinement towards a design model for circuit implementation.

The techniques adopted in the framework are applicable in general to the systems, where the potential attack scenarios can be modeled in a formalism based on extended abstract state machines. The attack events, i.e., attack test vectors chosen from the attacks happening in real-world are converted to the test driver specific events ready to be tested against the attack signatures. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the most common attack scenarios.

As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data required by OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. However, user requirements for OLAP systems change over time. Data warehouses and OLAP systems thus are rather dynamic and the design process is continuous. In order to easily incorporate new requirements and at the same time ensure the quality of the system design, we suggest to apply the Abstract State Machine (ASM) based development method. This assumes we capture the basic user requirements in a ground model and then apply stepwise refinements to the ground model for every design decisions or further new requirements.

It is straightforward to represent such an automaton as an Abstract State Machine (ASM). In doing so we enable computations on abstract states that are defined by a certain class of automata, in this case VPAs. In this paper we elaborate on this approach by taking also updates of XML documents into account. In this way the ASM-approach combines vertical refinements, which first make states explicit and then instantiate by a specific EDTD, with horizontal refinements, which replace streaming XML documents by stored ones and then add updates. Furthermore, as the EDTD appears as part of the abstract state, updating it is another natural extension by horizontal refinement. In this way we obtain consistently integrated updates and schema updates for XML documents, which can even be extended to become fault-tolerant by taking at most k errors in the document into consideration. It further provides an example of ASM-based computation with automata-defined states.","[Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Informat Sci Res Ctr, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Thalheim, Bernhard] Univ Kiel, Inst Comp Sci, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Wang, Qing] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Kiel; University of Otago,"Schewe, KD (corresponding author), Informat Sci Res Ctr, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",kdschewe@acm.org; thalheim@is.informatik.uni-kiel.de; qing.wang@otago.ac.nz,,"Wang, Qing/0000-0001-9504-4273",,,,,28,1,1,0,0,"GRAZ UNIV TECHNOLGOY, INST INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPUTER MEDIA-IICM",GRAZ,"INFFELDGASSE 16C, GRAZ, A-8010, AUSTRIA",0948-695X,,,J UNIVERS COMPUT SCI,J.

Various UML, diagrams are used for specification of different aspects of the application. Their interpretation, extension, revision and integration becomes awful difficult if developers use the full freedom of UML, apply their own semantics and do not agree an common parts. We propose an approach that limits this freedom to the necessary extend. Developers have the full freedom on parts of the specification that is independent from others and are committed to fulfill contracts on parts of the specification that is also used by other developers. Due to a lack of semantics the integration of various UML diagrams is often left to the intuition of software engineers, which bears the risk of UML-based software development becoming error-prone. In this paper we propose the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as a means to support the integration of UML diagrams by means of invertible translations of UML clusters, i.e. sets of UML diagrams together with constraints defined on them, into easily understandable ASM specifications. In doing so, the rigorous semantics of ASMs induces an unambiguous semantics for the UML clusters. These translations themselves can be formalised by ASM specifications thereby automating the translation process. Furthermore, the evolution of UML clusters is guarded by contracts, which can again by specified by ASMs.","[Schmidt, Peggy; Thalheim, Bernhard] Univ Kiel, Inst Comp Sci, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Schmidt, P (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Comp Sci, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",pescthalheim@is.informatik.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-642-11446-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2009,5115,,,,,,111,129,,,,,,19,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BPM85,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000279345300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of a (self-stabilizing) infrastructure such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system for their execution. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this article, we present our design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler.

This was accomplished in three different ways, leading to three, seemingly disparate, notions of effectiveness.

Among these postulates the background postulate supposedly captures the particularities of data models and schemata. For the characterisation of XML database transformations the natural first step is therefore to define the appropriate tree-based backgrounds, which draw on hereditarily finite trees, tree algebra operations, and extended document type definitions. This defines a computational model for XML database transformation using a variant of Abstract State Machines. Then the incorporation of weak monadic second-order logic provides an alternative computational model called XML machines.

In particular, we focus on multi-agent ASMs extended with the seq construct for turbo ASMs. We explain why traditional data flow analysis can not simply be applied to ASMs: data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph whereas in this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph. We revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis taking into account the specific, parallel nature of ASMs, and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. In particular, we analyze the role played by different types of terms in ASMs and deal with the problem of terms that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, terms that are shared between several agents, and derived terms. We also discuss what consequences the use of the turbo ASM construct seq has on our analysis and revise the approach accordingly. Finally, we specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria for this class of ASMs and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.","Univ Oxford, Comp Lab, Oxford OX1 3QD, England",University of Oxford,"Cavarra, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Comp Lab, Wolfson Bldg,Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QD, England.",alessandra.cavarra@comlab.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0934-5043,1433-299X,,FORM ASP COMPUT,Form.

ISAs are typically implemented in hardware as microprocessors, but also in software running on a host processor, i.e. virtual machines (VMs). Despite there being many ISAs in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of robust ISAs by the formal construction of all normal and exception conditions for each instruction. This is a task to which the Event-B (Metayer et al. in Rodin deliverable 3.2 Event-B language, http://rodin.cs.ncl.ac.uk, 2005; Schneider in The B-method an introduction, Palgrave, Basingstoke, 2001) formal notation is well suited. This paper describes a project to use the Rodin tool-set (Abrial in Formal methods and software engineering, Springer, Berlin, 2006) to perform such a process, ultimately producing two variants of the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) ISA (Wright in Abstract state machines, B and Z, Springer, Berlin, 2007; Wright in MIDAS machine specification, Bristol University, http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications, 2009) as VMs. The abstract model is incrementally refined to variant models capable of automatic translation to C source code, which this is compiled to create useable VMs. These are capable of running binary executables compiled from high-level languages such as C (Kernighan and Ritchie in The C programming language, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1988), and compilers targeted to each variant allow demonstration programs to be executed on them.","[Wright, Stephen; Eder, Kerstin] Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Wright, S (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",stephen.wright@bristol.ac.uk,,"Eder, Kerstin/0000-0001-9746-1409",,,,,34,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0934-5043,,,FORM ASP COMPUT,Form.

While we specify our designs using ASMs, we do not mandate this. Instead, one can create translators that convert the algorithmic specifications from C-like languages into their equivalent ASM specifications.

One main difference from data refinement is that ASM refinement considers infinite runs and termination. Since backward simulation does not preserve termination in general, the standard technique of adding history information to the concrete level is not applicable to get a completeness proof. The power set construction also adds infinite runs and is therefore not applicable either. This paper shows that a completeness proof is nevertheless possible by adding infinite prophecy information, effectively moving nondeterminism to the initial state. Adding such prophecy information can be done not only on the semantic level, but also by a simple syntactic transformation that removes the choose construct of ASMs. The completeness proof is also translated to a completeness proof for IO automata. Finally, the proof is extended to deal with supplementary predicates, that specify fairness and liveness assumptions, by transferring a related result of Wim Hesselink for refinements that use the Abadi-Lamport setting.

This is largely due to the intricacy of the analog behavioral intent which cannot be captured purely in terms of logic. In this paper, we show that by using auxiliary forms of formal specifications such as abstract state machines and real-valued functions, called auxiliary functions, as references for AMS assertions, it becomes possible to model complex AMS behavioral properties. In addition, we present complexity results for the satisfiability problem of such specifications. This approach leverages the growing adoption of AMS behavioral modeling in the industry. This paper also shows that the use of auxiliary state machines allows us to separate out the scope of different analog assertions leading to significant performance gains in the assertion checking overhead.","[Mukherjee, Subhankar; Dasgupta, Pallab] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Mukhopadhyay, Siddhartha] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Mukherjee, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",subhankar@cse.iitkgp.ernet.in; pallab@cse.iitkgp.ernet.in; smukh@ee.iitkgp.ernet.in,,,SRC/GRC [2008-TJ-1835],SRC/GRC,"This work was supported by the SRC/GRC research contract, under Project 2008-TJ-1835.

Our results show that a set of effective models can be developed with this approach that can either be used directly or further refined using a modeller's domain knowledge. Such an approach can greatly reduce the time taken to develop new models, enabling a modeller to focus on the subtler modelling aspects of the problem domain.

Care: there is in general no way to compute this critical finite part without querying the function on an arbitrarily larger finite part! Nevertheless, things are different in case there is a uniform bound on the size of the domain of this critical finite part. We prove that, modulo a quadratic blow-up of the bound, one can compute the value of the functional by an algorithm which queries the input function on a uniformly bounded finite part. Up to a constant factor, this quadratic blow-up is optimal. We also characterize such functionals in topological terms using uniformities.

Nondeterminism poses several challenges for the validation and verification activities, including the problem of inconclusive tests in model-based testing with model checker. It is a validation technique that uses model checker counterexamples as test cases. In this paper, we tackle the problem of testing nondeterministic systems by combining model-based testing and runtime conformance monitoring: the input sequences of the tests are automatically generated from nondeterministic models; then their execution is runtime monitored to check conformance of the code w.r.t. its specification.

Embedded in combined fragments, these operators are intended to simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of its events. However, the latest specification introduces a non-trivial degree of ambiguity in the interpretation and understanding of sequence diagrams. As these diagrams are increasingly adopted as modeling tools in embedded software, their ambiguity can exacerbate the challenges encountered in embedded system design. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of the loop, break and strict operators in sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and their related constraints.","[Ejnioui, Abdel] Univ S Florida, Dept Informat Technol, Lakeland, FL 33803 USA; [Otero, Carlos E.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Melbourne, FL USA; [Qureshi, Abrar A.] Univ Virginias Coll Wise, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Wise, VA 22903 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Florida Institute of Technology; University of Virginia,"Ejnioui, A (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Informat Technol, Lakeland, FL 33803 USA.",,"Otero, Carlos/M-1141-2015","Otero, Carlos/0000-0003-4869-0453",,,,,5,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2381-3474,,,IEEE CONF OPEN SYST,IEEE Conference on Open Systems,,2013,,,,,,,106,+,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BC0OH,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000349255600021,View Full Record in Web of Science

However the reactive approaches are usually tightly coupled to a particular embodiment making transfer of knowledge difficult. This paper proposes a paradigm for modeling and execution of reactive manipulation actions, which makes knowledge transfer to different embodiments possible while retaining the reactive capabilities of the embodiments. The proposed approach extends the idea of control primitives coordinated by a state machine by introducing an embodiment independent layer of abstraction. Abstract manipulation primitives constitute a vocabulary of atomic, embodiment independent actions, which can be coordinated using state machines to describe complex actions. To obtain embodiment specific models, the abstract state machines are automatically translated to embodiment specific models, such that full capabilities of each platform can be utilized. The strength of the manipulation primitives paradigm is demonstrated by developing a set of corresponding embodiment specific primitives for object transport, including a complex reactive grasping primitive. The robustness of the approach is experimentally studied in emptying of a box filled with several unknown objects. The embodiment independence is studied by performing a manipulation task on two different platforms using the same abstract description. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting their reliability is very important to appropriately drive the selection and assembly of services, to evaluate design feasibility, to compare design alternatives, to identify potential failure areas and to maintain an acceptable reliability level under environmental extremes. This article presents a model for predicting reliability of a service-oriented application based on its architecture specification in the lightweight formal language SCA-ASM. The SCA-ASM component model is based on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method Abstract State Machines for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. The proposed method provides an automatic and compositional means for predicting reliability both at system-level and component-level by combining a reliability model for an SCA assembly involving SCA-ASM components, and a reliability model of an SCA-ASM component. It exploits ideas from architecture-based and path-based reliability Models. A set of experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its comparison with a state-of-the art BPEL-based approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (ITS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose). Finally, the verified transformation is mechanized in the theorem prover Coq. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In order to support the engineering of service-oriented software applications, foundational theories, service modeling notations, evaluation techniques fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach are required. This article introduces a framework for modeling and prototyping service-oriented applications. The framework consists of a precise and executable language, SCA-ASM, for model-based design, and of a tool for early and quick design evaluation of service assemblies. The language combines the OASIS/OSOA standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) capability of modeling and assembling heterogeneous service-oriented components in a technology agnostic way, with the rigor of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method able to model notions of service behavior, interactions, orchestration, compensation and context-awareness in an abstract but executable way. The tool is based on existing execution environments for ASM models and SCA applications. An SCA-ASM model of a service-oriented component, possibly not yet implemented in code or available as off-the-shelf, can be (i) simulated and evaluated offline, i.e. in isolation from the other components; or (ii) executed as abstract implementation (or prototype) together with the other components implementations according to the chosen SCA assembly. As proof of concept, a case study taken from EU research projects has been considered to show the functionalities and potentialities of the proposed framework.","[Riccobene, Elvinia] Univ Milan, Dept Comp Sci, I-26013 Crema, CR, Italy; [Scandurra, Patrizia] Univ Bergamo, Dept Engn, Dalmine, BG, Italy",University of Milan; University of Bergamo,"Riccobene, E (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Comp Sci, Via Bramante 65, I-26013 Crema, CR, Italy.",elvinia.riccobene@unimi.it,"; Riccobene, Elvinia/B-7517-2013","SCANDURRA, Patrizia/0000-0002-9209-3624; Riccobene, Elvinia/0000-0002-1400-1026",,,,,64,17,19,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0934-5043,1433-299X,,FORM ASP COMPUT,Form.

We model these systems and we show how it is possible to generate tests in a very efficient way that exploits the division of the entire system in subsystems.

Reliability is one of the most important quality dimensions for Web services, since predicting their reliability is fundamental to appropriately drive the selection and the assembly of services. This chapter presents two approaches to predict the reliability of a Web service architecture. The first one is based on the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), the de facto standard executable language for specifying actions within business processes with Web services. The second one is based on the SCA-ASM, a lightweight formal language for modeling service-oriented applications, which is based on the OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method abstract state machines (ASMs) for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. Through a set of experimental results, we show how the two models work on a smartphone mobile application example, and we discuss the effectiveness of the SCA-ASM approach in comparison with the BPEL-based approach.","[Mirandola, Raffaela] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Potena, Pasqualina; Scandurra, Patrizia] Univ Bergamo, Dalmine, BG, Italy; [Riccobene, Elvinia] Univ Milan, Crema, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Bergamo; University of Milan,"Scandurra, P (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dalmine, BG, Italy.",raffaela.mirandola@polimi.it; pasqualina.potena@unibg.it; elvinia.riccobene@unimi.it; patrizia.scandurra@unibg.it,"; Riccobene, Elvinia/B-7517-2013","MIRANDOLA, RAFFAELA/0000-0003-3154-2438;",,,,,41,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG WIEN,VIENNA,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, A-1201 VIENNA, AUSTRIA",0943-853X,,978-3-319-17112-8; 978-3-319-17111-1,TEXT MG SYMB COMPUT,,,2015,,,,,,,229,256,,10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_7,,,28,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BG4WS,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000389222200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper first proposes a formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The formal description for main artifact of the standard (function block) is presented in the paper. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model checker which is used to formally verify properties of applications developed in IEC 61499 standard. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the formal verification of the IEC 61499 control systems. The paper also highlights the other uses of verification such as portability of IEC 61499 based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard.

Data gathered from the monitoring components are used in calculating metrics and establishing a diagnosis for the system. Emphasis is put on failure detection and on ensuring non-functional requirements of the system such as fault-tolerance and resilience. The model introduced in this paper will be integrated in a cloud-enabled large-scale distributed system.

The standard aims at the portability of control applications that is however hampered by ambiguities in its execution semantics descriptions. In recent years several execution models have been implemented in different software tools that generate mutually incompatible code. This paper proposes a general approach to neutralizing these semantic ambiguities by formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The model embodies all known execution semantics of function blocks. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model-checker which is used to verify formally properties of applications. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the portability checking of component-based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The paper first discusses different existing execution semantics of function blocks and the portability issues across different IEC 61499 tools. Then a modular formal model of function blocks' operational semantics in ASM is introduced and exemplified in the paper by the cyclic execution semantics case for a composite function block. Subsequently, the SMV model is generated and model-checking is illustrated for a simple test case.","[Dubinin, Victor] Penza State Univ, Penza, Russia; [Patil, Sandeep; Pang, Cheng; Vyatkin, Valeriy] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden",Penza State University; Lulea University of Technology,"Patil, S (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden.",sandeep.patil@ltu.se; victor_n_dubinin@yahoo.com; cheng.pang.phd@ieee.org; vyatkin@ieee.org,"Dubinin, Victor/A-8365-2014; Pang, Cheng/N-1962-2013; Patil, Sandeep/I-9197-2019","Dubinin, Victor/0000-0002-5761-2249; Patil, Sandeep/0000-0003-2936-4185",,,,,25,16,16,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-662-46823-4; 978-3-662-46822-7,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2015,8974,,,,,,76,91,,10.1007/978-3-662-46823-4_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-46823-4_7,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BD7KR,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000363246500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among many other existing problems in cloud computing, we identified the lack of client orientation and lack of formal foundations as serious deficiencies. In this chapter, we give a summary on our research and discuss the architectures as well as the formal models of some software solutions with which we are going to address (a part of) these two problems in cloud computing. The solution we propose is a novel and uniform client-cloud interaction approach by which cloud service owners, who may be different from the cloud providers, are able to fully control the usage of their services in the case of each user subscription. In this context, any cloud service can be invoked by distinct devices; therefore, the content must be adapted to various channels and end devices, in particular with respect to needs arising from mobile clients. For a quick and seamless integration between the cloud provider's identity management system and the system used by the client, we introduce the concept of a client-centric tool. An extension of the client-cloud interaction model enables client-to-client interaction (CTCI) in an almost direct way, so that the involvement of cloud services is transparent to the users. In this chapter, we propose a formalization of this solution that incorporates the major advantages of abstract state machines (ASMs) and ambient calculus by specifying the algorithms of executable components (agents) in terms of ASMs and by describing their communication topology, locality, and mobility in the terms of ambient calculus.","[Bosa, Karoly; Holom, Roxana-Maria; Vleju, Mircea Boris] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Christian Doppler Lab Client Centr Cloud Comp, Softwarepk 21, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Bosa, K (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Christian Doppler Lab Client Centr Cloud Comp, Softwarepk 21, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria.",k.bosa@cdcc.faw.jku.at; r.holom@cdcc.faw.jku.at; b.vleju@cdcc.faw.jku.at,,"Holom, Roxana-Maria/0000-0002-1321-0475",,,,,118,11,12,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG WIEN,VIENNA,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, A-1201 VIENNA, AUSTRIA",0943-853X,,978-3-319-17112-8; 978-3-319-17111-1,TEXT MG SYMB COMPUT,,,2015,,,,,,,83,144,,10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17112-8_4,,,62,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BG4WS,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000389222200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A drawback of BPMN, however, is that modality is implicitly expressed through the structure of the process flow but not directly within the corresponding activity. Thus, an extension of BPMN with deontic logic has been proposed in previous work, called Deontic BPMN. Deontic BPMN reduces the structural complexity of the process flow and increases the readability by explicitly highlighting obligatory and permissible activities. In addition, an algebraic graph transformation from a subset of BPMN to Deontic BPMN, called Deontic BpmnGTS, has been defined. The goal of the current research is to show that DeonticBpmnGTS is terminating and confluent, resulting in a globally deterministic transformation. Moreover, the semantic equivalence of BPMN models and the respective Deontic BPMN models is proven based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs).

Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while nonfunctional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language. We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis.

Back office systems of authorities collect and store data entered by citizens and enterprises to support decision-making by civilians. The data represents both the state of citizens and enterprises, public service transactions, and the physical infrastructure including ownership relations. Whilst civilians use the data for decisions, data quality influences decision quality. As data steward, civilians have improved data quality by removing duplicate data and created specific data stores for reference data like addresses, enterprises, and citizens. Citizens and enterprises can use reference data to complete electronic public service request forms. To further improve data quality, civilians perform physical inspections and/or assess external data sources to validate for instance data consistency. Besides data steward, civilians are also data custodian: they provide processing and storage facilities. In this contribution, the author will argue that an innovative architecture separating data steward and data custodian roles, currently held by civilians, decreases the Total Cost of Ownership of authorities' IT and contributes to economic growth. In the proposed approach, persons and organizations take the data stewardship role, facilitated by a provider of a data custodian role either in the public or private domain. Civilians can access the data for decision-making. Civilians still act as data steward with respect to additional data resources than provided by citizens and enterprises in decision-making. The approach is illustrated by a case and supported by the governance policy of for instance Dutch Customs Authority.","[Hofman, Wout] Netherlands Inst Appl Technol TNO, Dept Tech Sci, Soesterberg, Netherlands",,"Hofman, W (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Appl Technol TNO, Dept Tech Sci, Soesterberg, Netherlands.",,,,EU FP7 SEC Cassandra,EU FP7 SEC Cassandra,This paper is funded by internal research in collaboration with various government authorities and EU FP7 SEC Cassandra.,,52,0,0,0,8,IGI GLOBAL,HERSHEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",2334-4520,2334-4539,,INT J PUBLIC ADM DIG,Int.

This is due to the fact that modeling languages currently used in these areas have informal definitions and ambiguous semantics, and therefore their use may be unreliable. Thanks to their mathematical foundation, formal methods can guarantee rigorous system design, leading to precise models where requirements can be validated and properties can be assured, already at the early stages of the system development. In this paper, we present a rigorous engineering process for distributed systems, based on the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formal method. We rely on the foundational notions of ASM ground model and model refinement to obtain a precise model for a client-server application for Cloud systems. This application has been proposed to tackle the problem of making Cloud services usable to different end-devices by adapting on-the-fly the content coming from the Cloud to the different devices contexts. The ASM-based modeling process is supported by a number of validation and verification activities that have been exploited on the component under development to guarantee consistency, correctness, and reliability properties.","[Arcaini, Paolo] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic; [Holom, Roxana-Maria] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Christian Doppler Lab Client Centr Cloud Comp Hag, Linz, Austria; [Riccobene, Elvinia] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Informat, Milan, Italy",Charles University Prague; Johannes Kepler University Linz; University of Milan,"Arcaini, P (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic.",arcaini@d3s.mff.cuni.cz,"Arcaini, Paolo/J-3616-2017; Riccobene, Elvinia/B-7517-2013","Arcaini, Paolo/0000-0002-6253-4062; Holom, Roxana-Maria/0000-0002-1321-0475;",Charles University research funds PRVOUK; Christian Doppler Society,Charles University research funds PRVOUK(Charles University Prague); Christian Doppler Society,The research reported in this paper has been partly supported by the Charles University research funds PRVOUK and by the Christian Doppler Society.,,50,14,15,0,7,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",0934-5043,1433-299X,,FORM ASP COMPUT,Form.

The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. in addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first order structures. The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every bther tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set.

This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Those aspect-oriented specifications often can be more easily reused than extensions that are implemented directly into an existing specification. Another use case is the extension of a specification with new functionality or features. Although this would be possible with refinement too, with aspect-orientation it is not necessary to augment the original specification with extension points that can be used for refinement. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect-oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented according to an aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. The applicability of aspect oriented specification in the context of ASM is demonstrated by means of examples, e.g. implementing a fading aspect into the light control system specification of a former ASM case study. Finally, the paper gives a brief overview about the developed tool that supports the writing of aspect-oriented ASMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, many formal methods rely on a refinement-based development process which poses problems for their integration into agile processes. We consider redundancies within refinement hierarchies as a challenge for the practical application of stepwise refinement and propose superimposition-based modularization of refinement steps as a potential solution. While traditionally, each model in a refinement hierarchy must be developed and maintained separately, our concept allows developers to specify the refinement steps that transform a model into a refined one. We have developed tool support for the language AsmetaL and evaluated our approach by means of a case study. The results indicate a reduction of complexity for the development artifacts in terms of their overall size by 48.6% for the ground model and four refinements. Furthermore, the case study shows that superimposition-based refinement eases the development of alternative refinements for exploratory development and to cope with changing requirements. Thus, we consider this work as a step towards agile formal methods that are tailored to support iterative development, facilitating their incorporation into agile development processes.","[Benduhn, Fabian; Saake, Gunter] Univ Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany; [Thuem, Thomas; Schaefer, Ina] TU Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; Braunschweig University of Technology,"Benduhn, F (corresponding author), Univ Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.",fabian.benduhn@ovgu.de,,,DFG (German Research Foundation) under the Researcher Unit FOR1800: Controlling Concurrent Change (CCC); project EXPLANT (DFG) [SA 465],DFG (German Research Foundation) under the Researcher Unit FOR1800: Controlling Concurrent Change (CCC); project EXPLANT (DFG),"This work was partially supported by the DFG (German Research Foundation) under the Researcher Unit FOR1800: Controlling Concurrent Change (CCC) and project EXPLANT (DFG, grant SA 465).

In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a methodology capturing both the formal representation of ASM with the ability to generate safety properties from the STPA hazard analysis.

The envisioned architecture is built on case-based reasoning principles and stands at the base of the adaptation processes that are imperative for ensuring the delivery of high-quality software. The solution is further extended through ground models with a focus on reliability, availability of components, and failure tolerance in terms of abstract state machines. The novelty of the approach resides in making use of formal modeling for one of the emerging problems and introducing an adequate prototype, on top of which one can apply reasoning and verification methods.","[Nemes, Sorana Tania; Buga, Andreea] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Christian Doppler Lab Client Ctr Cloud Comp, Software Pk 35, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Nemes, ST (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Christian Doppler Lab Client Ctr Cloud Comp, Software Pk 35, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria.",t.nemes@cdcc.faw.jku.at; andreea.buga@cdcc.faw.jku.at,"Buga, Aneea/B-9307-2017","Buga, Aneea/0000-0001-5352-8974",,,,,34,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-61030-6; 978-3-319-61029-0,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2017,10339,,,,,,257,271,,10.1007/978-3-319-61030-6_18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61030-6_18,,,15,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BK3AB,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000434470400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation. Furthermore this includes the automatic generation of the associated traceability data and test specification documentation. An initial framework has been defined to support exchangeability of individual tasks in the generation toolchain. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by testing the complete heterogeneous signal communication of an exemplary avionics system, resp. platform instance, at system level as well as at software high-level.","[Mueller, Peter; Belschner, Tim; Reichel, Reinhard] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Aircraft Syst ILS, Pfaffenwaldring 27, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart,"Mueller, P (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Aircraft Syst ILS, Pfaffenwaldring 27, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",peter.mueller@ils.uni-stuttgart.de; tim.belschner@ils.uni-stuttgart.de; reinhard.reichel@ils.uni-stuttgart.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) within the LuFo V-1 program,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) within the LuFo V-1 program,This research has been funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) within the LuFo V-1 program.,,16,6,6,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1088-7725,,978-1-5090-4922-6,IEEE AUTOTESTCON,,,2017,,,,,,,232,239,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BJ4DJ,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000424908200040,View Full Record in Web of Science

The advantage of the Asm2C++ tool is that it is part of the Asmeta framework that allows to analyze, verify, and validate the correctness of a formal model.","[Bonfanti, Silvia; Carissoni, Marco; Gargantini, Angelo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Bonfanti, Silvia; Mashkoor, Atif] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg GmbH, Hagenberg Im Muhlkreis, Austria",University of Bergamo; Softwarepark Hagenberg,"Bonfanti, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.;Bonfanti, S (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg GmbH, Hagenberg Im Muhlkreis, Austria.",silvia.bonfanti@unibg.it; m.carissoni1@studenti.unibg.it; angelo.gargantini@unibg.it; atif.mashkoor@scch.at,"Mashkoor, Atif/AAK-6747-2020; Bonfanti, Silvia/AAD-9350-2019; Gargantini, Angelo/E-6060-2012","Mashkoor, Atif/0000-0003-1210-5953; Bonfanti, Silvia/0000-0001-9679-4551; Gargantini, Angelo/0000-0002-4035-0131","Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology; Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET center SCCH","Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology; Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET center SCCH","This work is partially supported by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, and the Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET center SCCH.",,7,23,25,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-57287-1; 978-3-319-57288-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2017,10227,,,,,,295,301,,10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_21,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BU3CS,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000890067500021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, formal methods for designing and assuring the functional correctness of the decentralized adaptation logic are highly demanded. This article presents a framework for formal modeling and analyzing self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a formalism, called self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, that exploits the concept of multiagent Abstract State Machines to specify distributed and decentralized adaptation control in terms of MAPE-K control loops, also possible instances of MAPE patterns.

Recently, it was shown that non-deterministic database transformations can be captured exactly by a variant of ASMs, the so-called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs). In this article we present a logic for DB-ASMs, extending the logic of Nanchen and Stark for ASMs. In particular, we develop a rigorous proof system for the logic for DB-ASMs, which is proven to be sound and complete. The most difficult challenge to be handled by the extension is a proper formalization capturing non-determinism of database transformations and all its related features such as consistency, update sets or multisets associated with DB-ASM rules. As the database part of a state of database transformations is a finite structure and DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers only over the database part of a state, we resolve this problem by taking update sets explicitly into the logic, i.e. by using an additional modal operator [X], where X is interpreted as an update set Delta generated by a DB-ASM rule. The DB-ASM logic provides a powerful verification tool to study properties of database transformations.","[Ferrarotti, Flavio; Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg Im Muhlkreis, Austria; [Tec, Loredana] RISC Software GmbH, Hagenberg Im Muhlkreis, Austria; [Wang, Qing] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Softwarepark Hagenberg; Australian National University,"Ferrarotti, F (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg Im Muhlkreis, Austria.",flavio.ferrarotti@scch.at; kdschewe@acm.org; loredana.tec@risc-software.at; qing.wang@anu.edu.au,,"Wang, Qing/0000-0001-9504-4273; Ferrarotti, Flavio/0000-0003-2278-8233","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P26452-N15, I2420-N31]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) through the COMET",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) through the COMET,The research reported in this paper results from the projects Behavioural Theory and Logics for Distributed Adaptive Systems and Higher-Order Logics and Structures supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF: [P26452-N15] & [I2420-N31]).

J,"Alkrarha, O; Hassine, J",,,,"Alkrarha, Osama; Hassine, Jameleddine",,,Applying selective mutation strategies to the AsmetaL language,IET SOFTWARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,". Abstract state machines (ASMs) have been introduced as a computation model that is more powerful and more universal than standard computation models. The early validation of ASM models would help reduce the cost and risk of having defects propagate, through refinement, to other models, and eventually to code; thus, adversely affecting the quality of the end product. Mutation testing is a well-established fault-based technique for assessing and improving the quality of test suites. However, little research has been devoted to mutation analysis in the context of ASMs. Mutation testing is known to be computationally expensive due to the large number of generated mutants that are executed against a test set. In this study, the authors empirically investigate the application of cost reduction strategies to AsmetaL, an ASM-based formal language. Furthermore, they evaluate experimentally the effectiveness and the savings resulting from applying two techniques: namely, random mutants selection and operator-based selective mutation, in the context of the AsmetaL language. The quantitative results show that both techniques achieved good savings without major impact on effectiveness.","[Alkrarha, Osama; Hassine, Jameleddine] KFUPM, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Hassine, J (corresponding author), KFUPM, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.",jhassine@kfupm.edu.sa,"Hassine, Jameleddine/E-5940-2015",,Deanship of Scientific Research at King Fahd University of Petroleum Minerals [IN121009],Deanship of Scientific Research at King Fahd University of Petroleum Minerals(King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals),The authors acknowledge the support provided by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals for funding this work through project no.

All these languages focus on the distribution of computation, which is somewhat the same as concurrent computation. In addition, there is also the aspect of distribution of state, which is often neglected. Distribution of state is most commonly represented by communication between active agents. This paper argues that it is desirable to abstract from the communication and to consider abstract distributed state. This includes semantic handling of conflict resolution, e.g. in connection with data replication. The need for abstract distribution of state is discussed and a novel semantics for concurrency based on an abstract distributed state is presented. This semantics uses runs over so-called multistates, and hides the internal communication for replica handling. This way, distributed computation is described over an abstract memory model.","[Prinz, Andreas] Univ Agder, Dept ICT, Agder, Norway",University of Agder,"Prinz, A (corresponding author), Univ Agder, Dept ICT, Agder, Norway.",andreas.prinz@uia.no,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-01042-3; 978-3-030-01041-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11150,,,,,,67,84,,10.1007/978-3-030-01042-3_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01042-3_5,,,18,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BN2UC,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000477756900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The theory comprises a set of language-independent postulates characterising the class of RSAs, an abstract machine model that provably satisfies the postulates, and a proof that all RSAs are captured by this machine model. As in Gurevich's thesis for sequential algorithms RSAs are sequential-time, bounded parallel algorithms, where the bound depends on the algorithm only and not on the input. Different from the class of sequential algorithms every state of an RSA includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. The model of reflective Abstract State Machines (rASMs) extends sequential ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state.","[Ferrarotti, Flavio; Schewe, Klaus-Dieter; Tec, Loredana] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria",Softwarepark Hagenberg,"Ferrarotti, F (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria.",flavio.ferrarotti@scch.at; kd.schewe@gmail.com; loredana.tec@gmail.com,,"Ferrarotti, Flavio/0000-0003-2278-8233","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P26452-N15, I2420N31]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2420] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),The research reported in this paper results from the projects Behavioural Theory and Logics for Distributed Adaptive Systems and Higher-Order Logics and Structure supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF: [P26452-N15] & [I2420N31]).,,14,10,10,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-74313-4; 978-3-319-74312-7,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,10742,,,,,,117,131,,10.1007/978-3-319-74313-4_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74313-4_10,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BL8CY,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000456072600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Monitors, as part of the system, are also affected by unavailability or random failures. In order to increase the reliability of the solution we verify the trustworthiness of the monitors and emphasize the need of redundancy. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying a monitoring solution for Large -Scale Distributed Systems. We formalize the behavior of the monitors with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model. The tool also supports the verification process by translating a simplified version of the model to an NuSMV specification, on top of which model checking can be applied.

It can be proven that any distributed adaptive system as stipulated by the axiomatisation can be step-by-step simulated by a crASM.

Whilst there is an Oracle implementation of SASL, its documentation also contains informal descriptions and under-defined specifications of the RFCs. This paper provides clarification of ambiguity in SASL using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This clarification is based on two ASM essential notions: a ground model to capture the intended SASL behavior in an understandable way, and a refinement notion to accurately explicate the ambiguous parts of the behavior. We also show some differences between RFCs and the description of the Oracle implementation.

One important obstacle to achieving this goal is that executing rules may result in a clash, that aborts the ASM run. This paper contributes three results towards this goal. First, it shows that it is possible to compute a first-order formula for each rule that implies clash-freedom when provable. The derived formula is not a precise characterization, but is provable for many ASMs that are used in practice. Second, we give axioms that describe the transition relation for clash-free ASM rules as formulas of predicate logic that can be used to verify pre/post-condition assertions using automated theorem provers. Third, we show that the relational encoding can be used to justify a calculus for clash-free ASM rules based on symbolic execution.

As yet, however, models of distributed computation are based on the idea that data is conceptually centralized. That is, they assume that data, even if it is distributed, is consistent. This assumption is not valid for many of the database systems in use today, where consistency is compromised to ensure availability and partition tolerance. Starting with an informal definition of eventual consistency, this paper explores several measures of inconsistency that quantify how far from consistency a system is. These measures capture key aspects of eventual consistency in terms of distributed abstract state machines. The definitions move from the traditional binary definition of consistency to more quantitative definitions, where the classical consistency is given by the highest possible level of consistency. Expressing eventual consistency in terms of abstract state machines allows models to be developed that capture distributed computation and highly available distributed data within a single framework.","[Sherratt, Edel] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales; [Prinz, Andreas] Univ Agder, Dept ICT, Grimstad, Norway",Aberystwyth University; University of Agder,"Sherratt, E (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales.",eds@aber.ac.uk; Andreas.Prinz@UIA.no,,"Sherratt, Edel/0000-0001-9913-1956",,,,,26,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-30690-8; 978-3-030-30689-2,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2019,11753,,,,,,249,265,,10.1007/978-3-030-30690-8_15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30690-8_15,,,17,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science,BP8XI,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000568450100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi) automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We describe, in the form of examples, an abstraction process which starts by extracting an initial ground-level ASM specification from Java source code (with the same core functionality), and ends in a high-level ASM specification at the desired level of abstraction.

The developed approach allows to build formal models of flexible distributed control systems for analysis and verification of various properties.","[Drozdov, Dmitrii; Patil, Sandeep; Vyatkin, Valeriy] Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden; [Drozdov, Dmitrii; Dubinin, Victor] Penza State Univ, Penza, Russia; [Vyatkin, Valeriy] Aalto Univ, Helsinki, Finland",Lulea University of Technology; Penza State University; Aalto University,"Drozdov, D (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden.;Drozdov, D (corresponding author), Penza State Univ, Penza, Russia.",dmitrii.drozdov@ltu.se; sandeep.patil@ltu.se; vyatkin@ieee.org,"Drozdov, Dmitrii/AFT-8598-2022; Dubinin, Victor/A-8365-2014; Patil, Sandeep/I-9197-2019","Dubinin, Victor/0000-0002-5761-2249; Patil, Sandeep/0000-0003-2936-4185",,,,,17,2,2,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1946-0740,1946-0759,978-1-7281-0303-7,IEEE INT C EMERG,,,2019,,,,,,,1682,1685,,10.1109/etfa.2019.8869293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/etfa.2019.8869293,,,4,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Manufacturing; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Telecommunications,BP5MR,,Green Submitted,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000556596600266,View Full Record in Web of Science

The process consists of the following steps: (1) model the system as an Abstract State Machine, (2) generate test sequences based on the ASM model, (3) compute the code coverage using generated tests, (4) if the coverage is low refine the Abstract State Machine and return to step 2.

Specific artefacts are usually developed to complement specification with validation and verification activities. To avoid boresome and time-consuming activities when reusing models, in a model refinement specification process, techniques supporting reusability of formal development artefacts are highly desirable. In this paper, we tackle the problem of defining a technique for automatic refinement of abstract test cases for formal models given in terms of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We present an approach, based on a classical test generation technique exploiting model checking, able to reuse information of test cases obtained at a given level of abstraction in order to define, in an automatic way, the same kind of artefacts at a subsequent refinement level.

Models that compute these functions are called Turing complete. For example, we know that common imperative languages (such as C, Ada or Python) are Turing complete (up to unbounded memory). Algorithmic completeness is a stronger notion than Turing-completeness. It focuses not only on the input-output behavior of the computation but more importantly on the step-by-step behavior. Moreover, the issue is not limited to partial recursive functions, it applies to any set of functions. A model could compute all the desired functions, but some algorithms (ways to compute these functions) could be missing (see [10, 27] for examples related to primitive recursive algorithms). This paper's purpose is to prove that common imperative languages are not only Turing-complete but also algorithmically complete, by using the axiomatic definition of the Gurevich's Thesis and a fair bisimulation between the Abstract State Machines of Gurevich (defined in [16]) and a version of Jones' While programs.

We formalise this problem by the notion of the greatest consistent specialisation (GCS) adapting and generalising this 20 year old concept to sequential Abstract State Machines (ASMs) with emphasis on bounded parallelism. In a state satisfying I such that P is repairable the notion of consistent specialisation will require an enlargement of the update set, which defines a partial order with respect to which a GCS is defined. We show that GCSs are compositional in two respects: (1) the GCS of an ASM with a complex rule can be obtained from the GCSs of the involved assignments, and (2) the GCS with respect to a set of invariants can be built using the GCSs for the individual invariants in the set.","[Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Zhejiang Univ, UIUC Inst, Haining, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Schewe, KD (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, UIUC Inst, Haining, Peoples R China.",kdschewe@acm.org,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-32408-7; 978-3-030-32409-4,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2019,11852,,,,,,219,235,,10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32409-4_14,,,17,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BZ2UR,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:001556638400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The type-2 theory of effectivity (TTE) is a well established theory of computability on infinite strings, which can be used to represent real numbers by rapidly converging Cauchy sequences, on top of which standard operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc. can be defined. In this paper we develop an extension of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) handling streams in an incremental way in accordance with TTE. This enables defining a data type Real as part of the background structure and based on this exact computation with real numbers. Output can be generated at any degree of precision by exploring only sufficiently long prefixes of the representing Cauchy sequences. We then outline an ASM development process that starts from a specification of an algorithm using Real, proceeds by making the rational elements of the Cauchy sequences explicit in a refinement, reconsiders this refined specification as a concurrent ASM, where each agent cares about computation up to some precision, and finally, based on a detailed analysis of the required precision, prunes the concurrent ASM down to an ASM that guarantees a sufficient level of precision in the outputs. In doing so, backward precision propagation replaces the common forward error propagation that is common for implementations exploiting floating point arithmetic. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests.

It provides a conceptual bridge between the physical implementation of the machine and the abstraction available to a programmer, while having portable and scalable performance predictions of BSP algorithms on most HPC systems. Two questions may come to mind. What are formally BSP algorithms? And how to ensure that the programmer can effectively program every BSP algorithm with a BSP language, especially with the right cost? curevich proved that three convincing postulates for the sequential algorithms are equivalent to what is called Abstract state machines (Asms), and thus that ASMS capture the sequential algorithms. Firstly, we extend these sequential postulates and ASMS in order to intuitively and realistically capture the asp algorithms (and not more). Secondly, by using an operational semantics and an algorithmic simulation, we prove that ASM(BSP) is equivalent to IMPBSP, a minimal imperative BSP programming language. Therefore, BSP programming languages (extending at least IMPBSP) are BSP algorithmically complete, involving the definition of a class model of the BSP algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, we remained intrigued by the fact that Blass and Gurevich used partial-order runs of distributed ASMs to explain runs of sequential recursive algorithms. We discovered that also the inverse simulation holds: for every distributed ASM with partial order runs, these runs can be described by runs of a sequential recursive algorithm.

Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this paper the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs to capture inferences on rASMs. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location.

The framework is called AsmetaS@run.time and is being developed as part of the ASM specification and analysis toolset ASMETA.","[Riccobene, Elvinia] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Informat, Milan, Italy; [Scandurra, Patrizia] Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ & Technol Management Informat Technol &, Bergamo, Italy",University of Milan; University of Bergamo,"Scandurra, P (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ & Technol Management Informat Technol &, Bergamo, Italy.",elvinia.riccobene@unimi.it; patrizia.scandurra@unibg.it,"; Riccobene, Elvinia/B-7517-2013","SCANDURRA, Patrizia/0000-0002-9209-3624; Riccobene, Elvinia/0000-0002-1400-1026",,,,,30,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-030-59154-0; 978-3-030-59155-7,COMM COM INF SC,,,2020,1269,,,,,,395,410,,10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_29,,,16,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX7AC,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:001315952700029,View Full Record in Web of Science

The MSL-centric framework allows the definition of the structure of MAPE-K loops using the MAPE Specification Language (MSL), and the description of its adaptation logic in terms of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). These models can be tested by exploiting classical model-based testing for ASMs that allows structural coverage of ASM models, but which is not adequate to test executions that are peculiar of the structure of MAPE-K loops. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a MAPE-based testing approach, which generates, from the MSL model, test goals specifying requirements on the control loop executions, translates these into concrete test predicates for the corresponding self-adaptive ASM, and then generates (by using a model checking based technique) abstract tests covering these test predicates. Such abstract tests are suitable to test the desired executions of MAPE control loops.

Gurevich's behavioural theory of sequential algorithms (aka the sequential ASM thesis) gives a partial answer by defining (non-deterministic) sequential algorithms axiomatically, without referring to a particular machine model or programming language, and showing that they are captured by (nondeterministic) sequential Abstract State Machines (nd-seq ASMs). However, recursive algorithms such as mergesort are not covered by this theory, as has been pointed out by Moschovakis, who had independently developed a different framework to mathematically characterize the concept of (in particular recursive) algorithm. In this article we propose an axiomatic definition of the notion of sequential recursive algorithm which extends Gurevich's axioms for sequential algorithms by a Recursion Postulate and allows us to prove that sequential recursive algorithms are captured by recursive Abstract State Machines, an extension of nd-seq ASMs by a CALL rule. Applying this recursive ASM thesis yields a characterization of sequential recursive algorithms as finitely composed concurrent algorithms all of whose concurrent runs are partial-order runs.","[Borger, Egon] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Informat, Pisa, Italy; [Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Zhejiang Univ, UIUC Inst, Haining, Peoples R China",University of Pisa; Zhejiang University,"Börger, E (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Informat, Pisa, Italy.",boerger@di.unipi.it; kd.schewe@intl.zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,6,6,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0169-2968,1875-8681,,FUND INFORM,Fundam.

This machinery varies from one class of algorithms to another. Think for example of ruler-and-compass algorithms, arithmetical algorithms, and Blum-Shub-Smale algorithms. We believe that means-fit effectivity is meaningful and useful independently of the Church-Turing thesis. Means-fit effectivity is definable, at least in the theory of abstract state machines (ASMs).

The randomized entangled mixed states are a special kind of mixed states that exhibit genuine multipartite correlation. Such states are obtained by the application of randomized entangling operators to an arbitrary pair of qudits of a multiqudit system. The study of the entanglement of randomized mixed states is of great importance in quantum computation since any experimental implementation of entangled states in a realistic environment can be made by imperfect entangling gates. We give a brief review of some necessary background about unitary phase operators and phase states of a multi-qudit system. Evolved density matrices arise when qudits of the multi-qudit system interact via a Hamiltonian of Heisenberg type. The randomized entangled states associated with evolved density matrices are derived via the action of an entangling operator on a pair of two qudits {i, j} of the multi-qudit system with some probability p.

Such MAPE patterns have been proposed by means of a graphical notation, but without a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of components interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome these limitations. We present a domain-specific language, called MSL for MAPE Specification Language, to define and instantiate MAPE patterns and to give semantics to some semantic variation points of the equivalent graphical notation for MAPE pattern. We also provide a formal semantics of the language by means of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, an extension of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formalism to model self-adaptation. Such semantics definition comes with an automatic transformation of MSL models into formal executable models, and opens to the possibility of performing rigorous analysis (validation w.r.t. the adaptation requirements and verification of adaptation properties) of MSL models. Moreover, we present our current results toward a (long-term) realization of an MSL-centric framework, where MSL is the notation of a modeling front-end, on top of richer and more specific modeling, analysis, and implementation back-end frameworks. As proof of concept of our approach, we show the application of MSL and its formal support to a running case study in the field of home automation, by modeling an adaptive control of a virtual smart home developed with the OpenHAB runtime platform.

They should abstract irrelevant details and provide a precise and complete description of the behaviour of the system. This view of software specification can naturally be expressed by means of Gurevich's Abstract State Machines (ASMs). There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi-)automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We devise a method consisting in two phases. In the first phase we propose fully automated transformations from source code to base-level ASM specifications with the same core functionality. We present a prototype of an implementation of this phase which transforms Java code into base-level ASM specifications. The second phase consists in incrementally applying sound semi-automated abstraction procedures for ASMs to derive higher-level specifications, starting from the base-level ASM specification obtained in the first phase. This is by no means a trivial task. It opens up new and interesting research questions. We discuss possible methodologies to approach this task and provide a proof of concept in the form of elaborated and detailed examples.

We classify stream queries into three classes, memoryless, semi-memoryless and memorable, and provide the model for each class using MapReduce based on BSP. In addition, as some stream queries require large amounts of computing sources, the BSP computation model is extended to a model with unbounded many agents, but preserving the barrier synchronization. A behavioral theory is developed for this model extending the behavioral theory of the BSP model. This comprises an axiomatization, the definition of Infinite-Agent BSP abstract state machines (Inf-Ag-BSP-ASM) and the proof that such ASMs capture the unbounded synchronized computations.

In this paper, we pose the basis for the long-term development of an ASM-based user-friendly framework for the formal verification of security protocols. We introduce a mathematical-based set of templates to formalise common patterns in security protocols and a set of security properties. These templates facilitate the protocol formal verification by providing built-in functions and domains, as well as transition rules and property schema, to be customised according to the specific protocol to be verified. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of their application to a number of well-known cryptographic security protocols.","[Braghin, Chiara; Lilli, Mario; Riccobene, Elvinia] Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Via Celoria 18, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Riccobene, E (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Via Celoria 18, Milan, Italy.",chiara.braghin@unimi.it; mario.lilli@unimi.it; elvinia.riccobene@unimi.it,"; Riccobene, Elvinia/B-7517-2013","BRAGHIN, CHIARA/0000-0002-9756-4675; lilli, mario/0000-0001-7236-9171; Riccobene, Elvinia/0000-0002-1400-1026",SEED Project SENTINEL,SEED Project SENTINEL,The work was partially supported by the SEED Project SENTINEL.,,28,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-77542-1; 978-3-030-77543-8,TH CO SC GE ISS,,,2021,12709,,,,,,17,33,,10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77543-8_2,,,17,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BX3YV,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:001286420300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language.

Our goal is to investigate these language constructs in the context of state-based formal methods using ASMs as a representative of this kind of formal methods. We report on a controlled experiment with 105 participants to study the understandability of the three language constructs in the context of ASMs. Our hypotheses are influenced by the debate of object-oriented communities. We hypothesized that the understandability (measured by correctness and duration variables) shows significantly better understanding for interfaces and traits compared to mixins, as well as at least a similar or better understanding for traits compared to interfaces. The results indicate that understandability of interfaces and traits show a similar good understanding, whereas mixins shows a poorer understanding.

Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this article the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs, by means of which we can formally express properties a reflective algorithm must satisfy. The proof theory associated with the logic then enables static verification of adaptive systems. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The lack of theoretical foundations in the field of Software Engineering has a counterpart, as the theoretical foundations have not caught up with the development of practical software systems. This raises the question how a theory of computation should look like that modernises the classical theory and at the same time is suitable for practical systems development. This article is dedicated to a sketch of a theory of computation centred around the notion of algorithmic systems. I will argue that behavioural theories are key to the understanding, i.e. we require language-independent axiomatic definitions of classes of algorithmic systems that are accompanied by abstract machine models provably capturing the class under consideration. The machine models give further rise to tailored logics through which properties of systems in the considered class can be formalised and verified, and to fine-tuned classifications on the grounds of complexity restrictions. All extensions are conservative in the sense that the classical theory of computation is preserved, universal in the sense that all practical developments are captured uniformly, and practical in the sense that languages associated with the abstract machine models can be used for rigorous high-level systems design and development, and the logics can be exploited for rigorous verification of desirable properties of systems.","[Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Zhejiang Univ, UIUC Inst, 718 East Haizhou Rd, Haining 314400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Schewe, KD (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, UIUC Inst, 718 East Haizhou Rd, Haining 314400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",kd.schewe@intl.zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-10363-6; 978-3-031-10362-9,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2022,13299,,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/978-3-031-10363-6_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10363-6_1,,,14,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BU3RX,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:000893237400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The RATE approach consists in generating test sequences from ASMs and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. The process follows these steps: (1) model the system as an abstract state machine; (2) validate and verify the model; (3) generate test sequences automatically from the ASM model; (4) execute the tests over the implementation and compute the code coverage; (5) if the coverage is below the desired threshold, then refine the abstract state machine model to add the uncovered functionalities and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach in three case studies: a traffic light control system (TLCS), the IEEE 11073-20601 personal health device (PHD) protocol, and the mechanical ventilator Milano (MVM). By applying RATE, at each refinement level, we have increased code coverage and identified some faults or conformance errors for all the case studies. The fault detection capability of RATE has also been confirmed by mutation analysis, in which we have highlighted that, many mutants can be killed even by the most abstract models.","[Bombarda, Andrea; Bonfanti, Silvia; Gargantini, Angelo] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Bergamo, Italy; [Lei, Yu] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Arlington, TX USA; [Duan, Feng] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Software & IoT Engn, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Bombarda, Andrea; Bonfanti, Silvia; Gargantini, Angelo] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, Dalmine, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; University of Bergamo,"Bombarda, A; Bonfanti, S; Gargantini, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, Dalmine, Italy.",andrea.bombarda@unibg.it; silvia.bonfanti@unibg.it; angelo.gargantini@unibg.it; ylei@cse.uta.edu,"Bonfanti, Silvia/AAD-9350-2019; Gargantini, Angelo/E-6060-2012; Lei, Yu/IAN-0544-2023; Duan, Feng/JUV-4779-2023; BOMBARDA, ANEA/AHB-9415-2022","Bonfanti, Silvia/0000-0001-9679-4551; Gargantini, Angelo/0000-0002-4035-0131; Lei, Yu/0000-0002-1069-5980; Duan, Feng/0009-0001-2767-2486; BOMBARDA, ANEA/0000-0003-4244-9319",,,,,47,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-0833,1099-1689,,SOFTW TEST VERIF REL,Softw.

The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern is typically used in user interfaces (UIs), since it allows the separation between the internal representation of the information and the way it is shown to users. The main problem of using this approach in a formal setting, where formal models are used to specify the requirements and prove safety properties, is that those models are not directly used within the MVC pattern and, thus, all the activities performed at model-level are somehow lost when implementing the UI. For this reason, in this paper, we present the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), an extension of the classical MVC where the model is a formal specification, written using Abstract State Machines. This pattern is supported by the AsmetaFMVCLib, which allows the user to link the formal model with the view and the controller by using simple Java annotations. We present the application of fMVC on a simple example of a calculator for explanatory purposes, then we apply it to the AMAN case study, which has inspired the definition of fMVC. We discuss the advantages of fMVC and its shortcomings, trying to identify the scenarios where it should be applied and possible alternatives.","[Bombarda, Andrea; Bonfanti, Silvia; Gargantini, Angelo] Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Ingn Gest Informaz & Prod, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Gargantini, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Ingn Gest Informaz & Prod, Bergamo, Italy.",andrea.bombarda@unibg.it; silvia.bonfanti@unibg.it; angelo.gargantini@unibg.it,"Gargantini, Angelo/E-6060-2012; BOMBARDA, ANEA/AHB-9415-2022; Bonfanti, Silvia/AAD-9350-2019","Gargantini, Angelo/0000-0002-4035-0131; BOMBARDA, ANEA/0000-0003-4244-9319; Bonfanti, Silvia/0000-0001-9679-4551",,,,,14,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-33162-6; 978-3-031-33163-3,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2023,14010,,,,,,340,357,,10.1007/978-3-031-33163-3_25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33163-3_25,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX3YR,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:001286412600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Safety assurance at runtime can be addressed by using models formalizing those safety assertions the system has to guarantee during operation, and specifying enforcement strategies aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. This paper presents an approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the State Machine as runtime model to specify safety assertions and enforcement strategies for steering the correct system behavior. The enforcer software is designed to act as a proxy system which wraps around the software system to realize safety enforcement, both as black-box enforcement on unsafe I/O events and as gray-box enforcement on unsafe internal system changes. The proposed approach is supported by a component framework called RSE (Runtime Safety Enforcement) that is here illustrated by means of two real case studies in the health-care domain.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Unsecured use of connected devices can cause threats or damages to the users, so security assurance, which can be ensured by the use of formal methods, must be guar-anteed. Unfortunately practical usage of formal methods during the protocol design is very limited or missing at all. To address the problem of providing the designer with a user-friendly but rigorous design approach based on the use of formal methods, supporting security assurance already at the model level, but hiding the complexity of formal notations and verification techniques, in this paper we propose an approach, based on the Abstract State Machine formal method, for the specification and verification of security protocols. Specifically, we introduce a set of built-in primitives to model communication protocols and their security properties. Security verification can be carried out under the hypothesis of either a passive or an active attacker. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of its application to the Z-Wave protocol, claimed to be one of the most secure protocol for IoT devices communication thanks to the addition of the S2 Security class. We show the formal specification of the Z-Wave protocol and the security verification process. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the need for simulation engines for composed model execution is getting a growing interest. Along this research line, this paper presents the results of the compositional modeling and validation by scenarios of an industrial medical system, called MVM-Adapt, that we designed as an adaptive version of an existing mechanical lung ventilator deployed and certified to treat pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit the I/O Abstract State Machine formalism to model the device components as separate and interacting sub-systems that communicate through I/O events and adapt the device ventilation mode at run-time based on the health parameters of the patient. An orchestrated simulation coordinates the overall execution of these communicating I/O ASMs by exploiting suitable workflow patterns.

For this reason, architectural patterns, like the Model-View-Controller (MVC), are usually employed. The MVC aims to separate the representation of information (model) from its presentation to the user (view). One can use a formal model to study the system and the UI, but such formal models are separately developed and analyzed, and the results of the analysis cannot be assured for the actual implementation. To address this problem, we introduced the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), allowing the integration of Asmeta specifications into the model of the MVC-designed software. This paper extends the fMVC pattern and the framework to better support Java Swing components and enhance error management, including automatic model state rollback on input failure. Moreover, we propose an extension enabling testers to generate and reuse Avalla scenarios for UI validation. We demonstrate the framework's application, covering modeling, validation, and verification at the model level for the AMAN case study that inspired us during the definition of the fMVC pattern.

The abstract machine model is defined by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs), which extend ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state.","[Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Inst Natl Polytech Toulouse, ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France; [Ferrarotti, Flavio] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Softwarepark Hagenberg,"Schewe, KD (corresponding author), Inst Natl Polytech Toulouse, ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France.",kd.schewe@gmail.com; flavio.ferrarotti@scch.at,,,"Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); State of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET Module Dependable Production Environments with Software Security (DEPS) within the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies Programme","Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); State of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET Module Dependable Production Environments with Software Security (DEPS) within the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies Programme","The research of Flavio Ferrarotti has been funded by the Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK), the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), and the State of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET Module Dependable Production Environments with Software Security (DEPS) within the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies Programme managed by Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG.",,17,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-94532-8; 978-3-031-94533-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2026,15728,,,,,,15,30,,10.1007/978-3-031-94533-5_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-94533-5_2,,,16,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BZ4CM,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:001576331600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant financial losses. This paper introduces a method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The approach models a smart contract as an Abstract State Machine (ASM), where the absence of specific vulnerabilities is encoded as invariants. An existing symbolic execution technique for ASM models was extended and improved to enable the processing of the ASM models of the smart contracts. By symbolically executing the ASM, the method identifies faulty execution paths that violate these invariants, exposing potential vulnerabilities in the contract's behavior. Vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart contract can be generated using the symbolic execution results. As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running case study, the Auction smart contract. Furthermore, we discuss the results of applying the technique to a number of Solidity smart contracts.","[Braghin, Chiara; Riccobene, Elvinia; Valentini, Simone] Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Via Celoria 18, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Riccobene, E (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Via Celoria 18, Milan, Italy.",chiara.braghin@unimi.it; elvinia.riccobene@unimi.it; giuseppedelcastillo@acm.org; simone.valentini@unimi.it,"Valentini, Simone/NWH-4281-2025; Riccobene, Elvinia/B-7517-2013","Valentini, Simone/0009-0005-5956-3945; Del Castillo, Giuseppe/0009-0005-7020-6607; Riccobene, Elvinia/0000-0002-1400-1026",MUR National Recovery and Resilience Plan - European Union - NextGenerationEU [PE00000014],"MUR National Recovery and Resilience Plan - European Union - NextGenerationEU(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",This work was partially supported by project SERICS (PE00000014) under the MUR National Recovery and Resilience Plan funded by the European Union - NextGenerationEU.,,32,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-94532-8; 978-3-031-94533-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2026,15728,,,,,,31,51,,10.1007/978-3-031-94533-5_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-94533-5_3,,,21,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BZ4CM,,,,,2026-01-05,WOS:001576331600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The restrictions can be incorporated into the semantics of ASM rules such that update sets are only yielded, if the conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, the conditions can be checked in polynomial time on a simulating Turing machine. Finally, the conditions imply global insignificance, i.e. the final result is independent from the choices. These properties suffice to show that the ASMs restricted this way define a logic capturing PTIME, which we call insignificant choice polynomial time (ICPT).","[Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] CNRS, Inst Natl Polytech Toulouse, IRIT, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse,"Schewe, KD (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Natl Polytech Toulouse, IRIT, Toulouse, France.",kd.schewe@gmail.com,,,ANR project EBRP [ANR-19-CE25-0010]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-19-CE25-0010] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),"ANR project EBRP(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Agence Nationale Des Plantes Medicinales Et Aromatiques, ANPMA, Morocco); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))",Part of this work is supported by the ANR project EBRP:EventB-Rodin-Plus under grant no.
