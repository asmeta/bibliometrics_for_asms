However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g., in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed. We illustrate how the control construct can improve the code's readability on some examples. The proposed control construct is also released as a plugin for CoreASM.

The extensions lead to a typed version of ASMs and a more specific notion of strong data refinement, which incorporates the preservation of information content by means of schema dominance. Each typed ASM can be effectively translated into an equivalent ordinary one. Providing typed ASMs helps to exploit the existing logical formalisms used in data-intensive applications to define a ground model. Furthermore, strong data refinement helps to set up a refinement-based development method that uses provably correct standard refinement rules.

To specify programs we use Abstract State Machines. It is known that Abstract State Machines and first order timed logic are two very powerful formalisms apt to represent verification problems for timed distributed systems. However, the general verification problem represented in this way is undecidable. Prior, some decidable classes of verification problems were described in semantical properties that are in their turn undecidable. The decidable class of the present paper is described in syntactical terms. Though it admits no functions, only predicates, it is of practical interest and we give an example illustrating possible applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, tools for assisting this process for evolving specifications are still lacking. With evolving we denote adding extensions without refactoring. We want to create a tool assisting in the verification of evolving specifications. Our approach is to translate ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, construct the proofs as far as possible automatically, and check the proofs with the proof checker. Further, we want proofs of evolvable specifications also to be evolvable. This paper gives a brief overview of the approach and discusses the first step of this work, namely the translation of ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, with consideration of automation possibilities.

J	Reisig, W				Reisig, W.			The computable kernel of Abstract State Machines	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Abstract State Machines (ASMs); Computability on Tarski structures; Symbolic computation		State Machines (ASMs) were introduced as "a computation model that is more powerful and more universal than standard computation models", by Yuri Gurevich in 1985. ASMs gained much attention as a specification method. It is extremely flexible because any mathematical structure may serve as a state. Gurevich characterized the expressive power of ASMs in terms of intuitively convincing postulates. The core result of this paper shows that the next-state function M of an Abstract State Machine M can be described on a symbolic level, notwithstanding the generality of the model: The successor state M(S) of a state S is fully specified by the equivalence similar to(S) induced by S on the terms over the signature of M. Consequently, M(S) is computable in case similar to(S) is decidable. Furthermore, this result implies a notion of computability for general structures, e.g, for algorithms operating on real numbers.

J	Dausend, M; Raschke, A				Dausend, Marcel; Raschke, Alexander			Towards a comprehensive extension of abstract state machines for aspect-oriented specification	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Aspect-orientation; Abstract state machines; Semantics	SEMANTICS	With the paradigm of aspect-orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program's logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Those aspect-oriented specifications often can be more easily reused than extensions that are implemented directly into an existing specification. Another use case is the extension of a specification with new functionality or features. Although this would be possible with refinement too, with aspect-orientation it is not necessary to augment the original specification with "extension points" that can be used for refinement. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect-oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented according to an aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. The applicability of aspect oriented specification in the context of ASM is demonstrated by means of examples, e.g. implementing a fading aspect into the light control system specification of a former ASM case study. Finally, the paper gives a brief overview about the developed tool that supports the writing of aspect-oriented ASMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unlike other logics for ASMs which are based on dynamic logic, our logic is based on an atomic predicate for function updates and on a definedness predicate for the termination of the evaluation of transition rules. We do not assume that the transition rules of ASMs are in normal form, for example, that they concern distinct cases. Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. We show that several axioms that have been proposed for reasoning about ASMs are derivable in our system. We provide also an extension of the logic with explicit step information which allows to eliminate modal operators in certain cases. The main technical result is that the logic is complete for hierarchical (non-recursive) ASMs. We show that, for hierarchical ASMs, the logic is a definitional extension of first-order predicate logic.

So, many real usage scenarios might be impossible to reproduce and validate at design-time. As envisioned by the Models@run.time research community, the use of models at runtime is fundamental to address this challenge. Our focus is on providing guarantees for changing safety goals at runtime (a form of uncertainty) with the employment of mathematically-based runtime analysis techniques from the area of formal methods (FM@run.time). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the runtime simulation of Abstract State Machine models and the on-the-fly changes of safety assertions at the model level to provide software assurance guarantees at runtime. The framework is called AsmetaS@run.time and is being developed as part of the ASM specification and analysis toolset ASMETA.

CENELEC 50128 strongly recommends the utilization of finite statemachines during system modelling stage and formal proof methods during the verification and testing stages of control algorithms. Due to the high importance of interlocking table at the design state of a signalization system, the modelling and verification of interlocking tables are examined in this work. For this purpose, abstract state machines are used as a modelling tool. The developed models have been performed in a generalized structure such that the model control can be done automatically for the interlocking systems. In this study, NuSMV is used at the verification state. Also, the consistency of the developed models has been supervised through fault injection. The developed models and software components are applied on a real railway station operated by Metro Istanbul Co.

J	Schewe, KD; Thalheim, B; Wang, Q				Schewe, Klaus-Dieter; Thalheim, Bernhard; Wang, Qing			Updates, Schema Updates and Validation of XML Documents - Using Abstract State Machines with Automata-Defined States	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						XML; Validation; Abstract State Machines		The exact validation of streaming XML documents can be realised by using visibly push-down automata (VPA) that are defined by Extended Document Type Definitions (EDTD). It is straightforward to represent such an automaton as an Abstract State Machine (ASM). In doing so we enable computations on abstract states that are defined by a certain class of automata, in this case VPAs. In this paper we elaborate on this approach by taking also updates of XML documents into account. In this way the ASM-approach combines vertical refinements, which first make states explicit and then instantiate by a specific EDTD, with horizontal refinements, which replace streaming XML documents by stored ones and then add updates. Furthermore, as the EDTD appears as part of the abstract state, updating it is another natural extension by horizontal refinement. In this way we obtain consistently integrated updates and schema updates for XML documents, which can even be extended to become fault-tolerant by taking at most k errors in the document into consideration. It further provides an example of ASM-based computation with automata-defined states.

It enables multiple users to access the database concurrently while preserving transactional properties such as atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. In this paper, we propose a formal framework specification for transaction processing. Our work can be seen as an extension of previous work by Gurevich et al. who have presented a formalism for general database recovery processing. Based on this formalism, we incorporate additional mechanisms that remove several explicit constraints, support normal transaction processing, and, most importantly, apply the approach to more advanced recovery mechanisms.

Gurevich's "Abstract-State Machine" model takes a more liberal position: Any mathematical structure may serve as a state. This results in,:a computational model that is more powerful and more universal than standard computation models" [5]. We characterize the Abstract-State Machine model as a special class of transition systems that widely extends the class of "computable" transition systems. This characterization is based on a fundamental Theorem of Y. Gurevich.

For the sake of generality and to also support rigorous high-level system design practice we give the definition in terms of Abstract State Machines. We show the definition to uniformly capture the common static and dynamic disciplines for isolating states or concurrent behavior (e.g. handling of multiple threads for Java) as well as for sharing memory, patterns of object-oriented programming (e.g. for delegation, incremental refinement, encapsulation, views) and agent mobility.

We show that liveness conditions such as invariance, conditional and unconditional progress, and persistence on all or some runs of an ASM can be expressed in this logic. We show the existence of a complete fragment of MLASM, which still contains the interesting liveness conditions, and demonstrate the usefulness of this complete fragment by an example concerning mutual exclusion.

To keep requirements complexity under control, system components are specified by separate models, validated and verified in isolation from the rest, but models have to be subsequently integrated and validated as a whole. For this reason, engines for orchestrated simulation of separate models are extremely useful. In this paper, we present a compositional simulation technique for managing the co-execution of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) communicating through I/O events. The proposed method allows the cosimulation of ASM models of separate subsystems of a Discrete Event System in a straight-through processing manner according to a predefined orchestration schema. We also present our experience in applying and validating the proposed technique in the context of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano) system, a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It has also been shown that the use of formal methods such as Abstract State Machines (ASMs) can contribute to high-quality designs, in particular, if standard refinements can be exploited. In this paper we continue a direction of research that exploits a typed version of ASMs for this purpose in order to be able to preserve the advantages that arise from using declarative languages. In order to support schema dominance we also employ a restricted notion of refinement, which we call strong data refinement. In particular, we show how view integration can be supported by standard refinement rules.

The logic can be used to prove security properties of ASMs like that the machine does not read locations containing critical information or that all accesses of the machine to the abstract memory are permitted. The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs. The logic is complete for hierarchical ASMs and still sound for turbo ASMs. It is integrated in the ASMKeY theorem prover. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They have been developed as part of the ASMETA (ASMs mETAmodelling) toolset, which is a set of tools for ASMs based on the metamodelling approach of the Model-driven Engineering. We briefly present the ASMETA framework, and we discuss how the language and the simulator have been developed exploiting the advantages offered by the metamodelling approach. We introduce the language AsmetaL used to write ASM specifications, and we provide the AsmetaL encoding of ASM specifications of increasing complexity. We explain the AsmetaS architecture, its kernel engine, and how the simulator works within the ASMETA tool set. We discuss the features currently supported by the simulator and how it has been validated.

System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a semiformal hazard analysis method that aims to identify safety requirements emerging from the analysis of potential interactions among components and inadequate control in the system's design. In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a methodology capturing both the formal representation of ASM with the ability to generate safety properties from the STPA hazard analysis. This has the advantages of verifying the STPA requirements in a formal way, and giving insights for the improvement of the ASM specification, depending on these requirements. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to an insulin pump control system case study, showing what safety issues it highlights.

In line with such a vision, this paper describes our experience in modeling the behavior of the MVM-Adapt, an adaptive version of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that has been designed, certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic for treating pneumonia. To keep the complexity of the requirements and models under control, we exploited a compositional modeling technique for discrete-event systems based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Essentially, separate ASMs represent the behavior of interacting subsystems of the MVM with their new adaptive functionalities; they can communicate with each other through I/O events, and co-operate by a precise orchestration schema.

We show how programming features (read: programming constructs) modularize not only the source programs, but also the program property statements and their proofs.

Such systems are characterized by high complexity and heterogeneity. Maintaining a high-level availability and a normal execution of the components implies precise monitoring and robust adaptation. Monitors capture relevant metrics and transform them to meaningful knowledge, which is further used in justifying adaptation actions. The current paper proposes an Abstract State Machine model for defining monitoring processes addressing failures and unavailability of the system nodes. The specification is simulated and validated with the aid of the ASMETA toolset. The solution is complemented with a small ontology reflecting the structure of the system. We emphasize the role of formal models in achieving the proposed requirements.

The role of a robust monitoring framework is to gather low-level data and assess the status of the components of the system. The framework collaborates with adapters for ensuring steady recovery plans and improving the availability of services. Monitors, as part of the system, are also affected by unavailability or random failures. In order to increase the reliability of the solution we verify the trustworthiness of the monitors and emphasize the need of redundancy. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying a monitoring solution for Large -Scale Distributed Systems. We formalize the behavior of the monitors with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model. The tool also supports the verification process by translating a simplified version of the model to an NuSMV specification, on top of which model checking can be applied. Properties of the model are expressed with the aid of computation tree logic.

J	Ouimet, M; Lundqvist, K				Ouimet, Martin; Lundqvist, Kristina			The Timed Abstract State Machine Language: Abstract State Machines for Real-Time System Engineering	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Real-Time Systems; Embedded Systems; Specification; Verification; Formal Methods; Abstract State Machines		In this paper, we present the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language, which is a language for the specification of embedded real-time systems. In the engineering of embedded real-time systems, the correctness of the system is defined in terms of three aspects - function, time, and resource consumption. The goal of the TASM language and its associated toolset is to provide a basis for specification-based real-time system engineering where these three aspects can be specified and analyzed. The TASM language is built on top of Abstract State Machines (ASM) by including facilities for compact and legible specification of non-functional behavior, namely time and resource consumption. The TASM language provides a notation which is well-suited to the specification needs of embedded real-time systems. We begin the presentation of the language with a historical survey on the use of ASM in specifying real-time systems. The core difference between the TASM language and ASM is that steps are inherently durative instead of being instantaneous and steps consume resources. These concepts capture the reality of physical systems in a flexible abstract model. We present the syntax and semantics of the language and illustrate the concepts using an extended version of the production cell case study.

As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to express structural and behavioral aspects of specifications. Our goal is to investigate object-oriented abstractions such as interfaces and traits for ASM-based specification languages. We report on a controlled experiment with 98 participants to study the specification efficiency and effectiveness in which participants needed to comprehend an informal specification as problem (stimulus) in form of a textual description and express a corresponding solution in form of a textual ASM specification using either interface or trait syntax extensions. The study was carried out with a completely randomized design and one alternative (interface or trait) per experimental group. The results indicate that specification effectiveness of the traits experiment group shows a better performance compared to the interfaces experiment group, but specification efficiency shows no statistically significant differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study studying the specification effectiveness and efficiency of object-oriented abstractions in the context of formal methods.

J	Bonfanti, S; Riccobene, E; Scandurra, P				Bonfanti, Silvia; Riccobene, Elvinia; Scandurra, Patrizia			Formal specification and validation of the MVM-Adapt system using Compositional I/O Abstract State Machines	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Compositional model-based simulation; Models@run.time; Discrete Event Systems modeling; Abstract State Machines		To face complexity and scalability, the design of software-intensive systems requires the decomposition of the system into components, each modeled and analyzed separately from the others, and the composition of their analysis. Moreover, compositional model simulation is recognized as the only alternative available in practice when systems are large and complex, like in the cyber-physical domain, and intrinsically require combining the specification of ensembles of different parts (subsystems). Therefore, the need for simulation engines for composed model execution is getting a growing interest. Along this research line, this paper presents the results of the compositional modeling and validation by scenarios of an industrial medical system, called MVM-Adapt, that we designed as an adaptive version of an existing mechanical lung ventilator deployed and certified to treat pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit the I/O Abstract State Machine formalism to model the device components as separate and interacting sub-systems that communicate through I/O events and adapt the device ventilation mode at run-time based on the health parameters of the patient. An orchestrated simulation coordinates the overall execution of these communicating I/O ASMs by exploiting suitable workflow patterns. This compositional simulation technique has proved to be useful in practice to validate the new adaptive MVM's behavior and thus to support architects in better understanding this new mode of operation of the prototyped system.

This paper proposes approach to formal modelling of IEC61499 function block execution semantics for popular model checking environment of SMV using Abstract State Machines. An operational semantics of IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model is presented using this framework. This paper first introduces the importance of model checking function block applications in different execution semantics. It highlights the uses of formal verification, such as, verifying portability (behavior) of component based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The formal model is applied on an example IEC 61499 application. The paper compares the verification results of this IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model and the same application with cyclic execution model presented in the earlier work. With this comparison, we verify the portability of the IEC61499 applications across different platforms.

Systems are modeled with basic Gurevich abstract state machines (ASMs), and requirements are expressed in a first order timed logic (FOTL). FOTL is undecidable, however the protocol we study is in a decidable class of practical interest. Advantages of this framework are twofold: on the one hand, a great expressive power which permits in particular an easy treatment of parameters, on the other hand the modeling task is simplified by an adequat choice of tools.

We define the semantics of concurrent ASMs by concurrent ASM runs which overcome the problems of Gurevich's distributed ASM runs and generalize Lamport's sequentially consistent runs. A postulate characterizing an intuitive understanding of concurrency is formulated. It allows us to state and prove an extension of the sequential ASM thesis to a concurrent ASM thesis.

The idea of this concept is analogous to the one of program slicing which is an established technique for extracting statements from a program that are relevant for its behaviour at a given point of interest. These statements form again a syntactically correct program called a slice. Previous work has focused oil programming languages that differ substantially from ASMs. Although the concept of program slicing does not directly extend to ASMs, it is possible to find an analogous concept for ASMs. We present such an approach. In spite of the fact that a minimal slice is not computable in the general case, we identify an expressive class of ASMs for which a minimal (static) slice is computable (and prove the computability). This basic result can be extended in several ways. We present some extensions to larger classes of ASMs and other variants for the notion of slicing.

In a distributed adaptive system (DAS) agents may change their programs, enter or leave the collection at any time thereby changing the behaviour of the overall system. The behavioural theory of DAS provides an axiomatic definition plus a proof that concurrent reflective abstract state machines (crASMs) captures all systems stipulated by the axioms. In this paper we take a closer look into crASMs emphasising the tree background structure that is needed for handling the manipulation of self-representations.

However in particular with distributed systems only various forms of communication may be available to share information. We define communicating ASMs by using instead of shared locations an explicit, abstract concept of Sending/Receiving messages which can be added to existing ASM execution engines. We aim to provide a definition which is a conservative extension of traditional ASMs, uniformly captures synchronous and asynchronous communication and is not bound to any specific message passing mechanism but can be instantiated to the major communication concepts in the literature. We illustrate the concept by an application to synchronous and asynchronous networks of communicating processes.

The thesis has been derived from basic principles for sequential algorithms, and for parallel synchronous algorithms. The main result of this paper is that the ASM thesis also holds for quantum algorithms. We first show that, and how, a general model of quantum algorithms (based on the combination of a classical computer with quantum circuits) can be modeled by abstract state machines. Following the approach of Blass and Gurevich to parallel algorithms, we then formulate general postulates for quantum algorithms and show that every algorithm satisfying these postulates is simulated by an appropriate ASM. These "quantum ASMs" are special cases of the parallel ASMs of Blass and Gurevich, but the only unbounded parallelism is inside the quantum operations (unitary transformations and measurements).

Only a few of these specifications are executable, although there are several interpreters and some compilers. This paper introduces a compilation scheme to transform a ASM specificatioin the syntax of the ASM-Workbench into C++. In particular, we transform algebraic types, pattern matching, functional expressions, dynamic functions, and simultaneous updates to C++ code. The main aim of this compilation scheme is to preserve the specification structure in the generated code without generating inefficient code. The implemented compiler was used successfully in the industrial FALKO application at Siemens Corporate Technology.

Our reductions are logspace computable (due to the syntactic restrictions we impose on ASM-programs) and are equally expressive as the logic (FO+DTC) enriched with the ability to handle sets. On ordered structures they precisely capture LOGSPACE. Our work continues that of Blass, Gurevich and Shelah on the choiceless fragment of PTIME. Indeed, our reductions can be seen as the choiceless fragment of LOGSPACE.

Time can be continuous or discrete. Time constraints are defined by linear inequalities. Two semantics are considered: with and without non-deterministic bounded delays between actions. The simulator is easily configurable. Simulation tasks can be generated according to descriptions in a special language. The simulator will be used for on-the-fly verification of formulas in an expressible timed predicate logic. Several features that facilitate the simulation are described: external functions definition, delays settings, constraints specification, and others.

Due to their nature, such operations can be used to analyze and handle "behavioral inconsistencies" and to prove component and system properties. The applicative aspects of the theoretical issues introduced in the paper are shown by means of three examples: the behavioral description of a telephone system presented in [7], the ASM specification of the Production Cell case study developed in (3], and the ASM solution of the railroad crossing problem given in [12].

In the ASM literature, however, there is a tendency to omit reflection on the process of ASM-based design and analysis, focusing instead on final, complete ASM products. As educators, we believe it is important to expose our students to a full, explicit process of inquiry, using ASMs as a vehicle to motivate active questioning. We report on our experiences in bringing ASM-based inquiry to the classroom. A course plan that combines ASMs and Problem :Frames has proved effective in eliciting critical inquiry among students.

ASM is a welldefined (formal) method based on algebraic concepts. A distinct feature of ASM is its combination of parallel and sequential execution semantics. This makes it an excellent choice to formally specify and verify micro-architectures. We present a compilation scheme and an implementation of a runtime system supporting efficient execution of ASM. After introducing novel analysis techniques we present optimizations allowing us to eliminate many costly operations. Benchmark results show that our baseline compiler is 2-3 magnitudes faster than other ASM implementations. The optimizations further increase the performance of the compiled programs up to 264%. The achieved performance allows our ASM implementation to be used with industry-size applications.

The logic can be used to prove security properties of ASMs like that the machine does not read locations containing critical information or that all accesses of the machine are in a well-defined region of the abstract memory. The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs. The logic is complete for hierarchical ASMs and still sound for turbo ASMs. It is integrated in the ASMKeY theorem prover.

Product family modeling using a graph grammar approach has been introduced by Du et al in [5]. In this paper we use graph grammar formalisms to build the abstract state machine (ASM) for the variety generation of the product family. The ASM is the first step in the computerization of the product family design. We consider the ASM as the appropriate tool for this purpose, because it is dynamic, succinct, precise and unambiguous. In this way, the product family design is transformed into a computational and direct production process of product variants.

Real numbers are represented by rapidly converging Cauchy sequences, on top of which standard operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc. can be defined. In this way exact computation with real numbers is enabled. Output can be generated at any degree of precision by exploring only sufficiently long prefixes of the representing Cauchy sequences.

We here give a formal definition of AsmL, its semantics, and we construct, for each AsmL program H, a normal form (which is an ASM program) H, computing the same function as H. The number of comparisons and updates during the execution of the normal form is at most three times the number of comparisons and updates in the original program.

The check computes a formula that, if provable, makes a relational encoding of ASM rules possible, which is an important prerequisite for efficient deduction. The check is general enough to cover all sequential rules as well as many typical uses of parallel composition.

The web browser model comes in four levels, namely transport, stream, context and browser level, and is focussed on the interaction with possibly multiple servers (which requires a concurrent computation model) and on script execution (which requires a dynamic assignment of agents to programs). The server model is focussed on the Request-Reply pattern, and specifies a delegation strategy where the handling of a request is entrusted to a module. We show how several major frameworks for web applications can be described as progressive refinements of a number of basic modules. Three modules are further detailed: static file transfer, CGI and generic scripting modules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Schellhorn, G				Schellhorn, G			ASM refinement and generalizations of forward simulation in data refinement: a comparison	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						abstract state machines; refinement; data refinement	LOGICAL OPERATIONAL SEMANTICS	In (J. Universal Comput. Sci. 7 (2001) 952), we have formalized Borger's refinement notion for Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The formalization was based on transition systems and verification conditions were expressed in Dynamic Logic. In this paper, the relation between ASM refinement and data refinement is explored. Data refinement expresses operations and verification conditions using relational calculus. We show how to bridge the gap between the different notations, and that forward simulation in the behavioral approach to data refinement can be viewed as a specific instance of ASM refinement with 1: 1 diagrams, where control structure is not refined. We also prove that two recent generalizations of data refinement, weak refinement and coupled refinement can be derived from ASM refinement. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, unlike other well-known formalisms, e.g. Petri nets, ASMs lack inherent, domain-independent characterisations of computationally important properties. Here, we provide an ASM-based characterisation of the starvation-free property. The classic, informal notion of starvation, usually provided in literature, is analysed and expressed as a necessary condition in terms of ASMs. Thus, we enrich the ASM framework with the notion of vulnerable rule as a practical tool for analysing starvation issues in an operational fashion.

Recently, it was shown that non-deterministic database transformations can be captured exactly by a variant of ASMs, the so-called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs). In this article we present a logic for DB-ASMs, extending the logic of Nanchen and Stark for ASMs. In particular, we develop a rigorous proof system for the logic for DB-ASMs, which is proven to be sound and complete. The most difficult challenge to be handled by the extension is a proper formalization capturing non-determinism of database transformations and all its related features such as consistency, update sets or multisets associated with DB-ASM rules. As the database part of a state of database transformations is a finite structure and DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers only over the database part of a state, we resolve this problem by taking update sets explicitly into the logic, i.e. by using an additional modal operator [X], where X is interpreted as an update set Delta generated by a DB-ASM rule. The DB-ASM logic provides a powerful verification tool to study properties of database transformations.

J	Zhao, J; Schewe, KD; Koehler, H				Zhao, Jane; Schewe, Klaus-Dieter; Koehler, Henning			Dynamic Data Warehouse Design with Abstract State Machines	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article	Workshop on Logic, Abstract States Machines and Databases	OCT-NOV -, 2007	Palmerston, NEW ZEALAND			Abstract State Machine; On-Line Analytical Processing; Data Warehouse; Refinement	INTEGRATION	On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems deal with analytical tasks that support decision making. As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data required by OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. However, user requirements for OLAP systems change over time. Data warehouses and OLAP systems thus are rather dynamic and the design process is continuous. In order to easily incorporate new requirements and at the same time ensure the quality of the system design, we suggest to apply the Abstract State Machine (ASM) based development method. This assumes we capture the basic user requirements in a ground model and then apply stepwise refinements to the ground model for every design decisions or further new requirements. In this article, we show that a systematical approach which is tailored for data warehouse design with a set of formal refinement rules can simplify the work in dynamic data warehouse design and at the same time improves the quality of the system.

However, they are not widely used in practice, since they are considered difficult to develop and understand. Visualization is often considered a good means for people to communicate and to get a common understanding. We here make a proposal of a visual notation for Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and we introduce visual trees that visualize ASM transition rules. In addition to these graphical components that are based only on the syntactical structure of the model, we also present visual patterns that permit to visualize part of the behavior of the machine. A tool is also available to graphically represent ASM models using the proposed notation.

In this paper, we show that when one is only interested in polynomial-time computations, BGS is strictly more powerful than both QL and while(new), two well-known computationally complete query languages. We then show that when a language such as while(new) is extended with a duplicate elimination mechanism, polynomial-time simulations between the language and BGS become possible.

S	Nowack, A		Borger, E; Gargantini, A; Riccobene, E		Nowack, A			Deciding the verification problem for abstract state machines	ABSTRACT STATE MACHINES 2003: ADVANCES IN THEORY AND PRACTIC, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Workshop on Abstract State Machines	MAR 03-07, 2003	TAORMINA, ITALY	Microsoft Res, Univ Pisa, Univ Catania, Proteo SpA			LOGICS	We study the decidability of general verification problems for ASMs. This corresponds to the question whether all computations of an ASM satisfy a property (usually expressed in some temporal logic). Because of undecidability in the general case, one has to identify classes of ASMs and classes of properties in order to receive positive decidability results. One idea for this could be to put simple restrictions on the ASMs as forbidding certain advanced constructs. But it turns out that this does not help much. Additionally, the restrictions in those cases are very strong. Consequently, one has to look for others. Such restrictions may result from techniques which are intended to be used in the proofs of decidability. One proof technique is the reduction to a decidable reasoning problem in logic. In [8] and [10], this has been applied to receive some positive decidability results. In this paper, we identify further classes of ASMs and classes of properties for which the general verification problem is decidable. Each proof is a reduction to the satisfiability problem of a fragment of linear temporal first-order logic which has respectively been proved to be decidable in [6] or [7].

This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Another use case for aspect orientation in specifications is the extension of specifications without touching the original ones. The definition of formal semantics for UML profiles without changing the original UML specification is an example for this application. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented with aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail.

(iii) We provide semi-automated support for agents in order to select the most specific pattern that fits their behavior at run-time. We have implemented the approach and our experiments with some real-world case studies show the viability of the proposed approach.

On one hand, this is due to the intrinsic complexity of the methods and, therefore, some level of required expertise is unavoidable. On the other hand, however, the methods are sometimes hard to use because of lack of a user-friendly tool support. In this paper, we present our experience in addressing usability when developing a framework for the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formal method. In particular, we discuss how we enhanced modeling, validation, and verification activities of an ASM-based development process. We also provide a critical review of which of our efforts have been more successful as well as those that have not obtained the results we were expecting. Finally, we outline other directions that we believe could further lower the adoption barrier of the method.

However, formal verification, and in general the use of formal methods, is slowed by myths and misconceptions, mainly due to their mathematical base, which discourages many designers or engineers from their adoption. In this paper, we pose the basis for the long-term development of an ASM-based user-friendly framework for the formal verification of security protocols. We introduce a mathematical-based set of templates to formalise common patterns in security protocols and a set of security properties. These templates facilitate the protocol formal verification by providing built-in functions and domains, as well as transition rules and property schema, to be customised according to the specific protocol to be verified. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of their application to a number of well-known cryptographic security protocols.

Parallel abstract state machines (parallel ASMs) are such parallel algorithms, and the parallel ASM thesis asserts that every parallel algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to a parallel ASM. In an earlier article, we axiomatized parallel algorithms, proved the ASM thesis, and proved that every parallel ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a parallel algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual parallel models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that parallel ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new parallel components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what parallel algorithms ought to be. We prove the parallel thesis for the new, corrected notion of parallel algorithms, and we check that parallel ASMs satisfy the new axioms.

Several tools have been produced to support UML model validation. These tools translate a UML model into a validation language such as PROMELA. However they have some shortcomings: there is no proof of correctness (with respect to the UML semantics) for these tools; and there is no tool that supports validation for both the static and dynamic aspects of a UML model. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present a toolset which is based on the semantic model using Abstract State Machines. Since the toolset is derived from the semantic model, the toolset is correct with respect to the semantic model, In addition, this toolset can be used to validate both the static and dynamic aspects of a model.

Since traditional data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph, they cannot be directly applied to AsMs. In this context we are interested hi tracing the flow of data, between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph. Therefore, we revise the classical concepts hi data How analysis and define them on two levels: the syntactic (title) level, and the computational (run) level. We also specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set; of coverage criteria from ASM Models.

For this the notion of service mediator has been coined, which captures specifications of composed services with slots that have to be filled by actual services. Such mediators can be specified by expressions in Kleene algebras with tests (KATs) or equivalently by very restricted Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this paper we address the refinement of such specifications with the intention to capture more meaningful conditions on the service slots and to fine-tune the matching of the slots with actual services. In particular, we investigate refinements that express user preferences thus leading to personalised mediators. For this form of adaptivity a previously developed term rewriting approach on KATs is generalised to refinements on ASMs.	[Schewe, Klaus-Dieter] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria; [Wang, Qing] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia	Softwarepark Hagenberg; Australian National University	Schewe, KD (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria.	kd.schewe@scch.at; qing.wang@anu.edu.au		Wang, Qing/0000-0001-9504-4273				Akkiraju R., 2005, Web Service Semantics - WSDL-S: W3C Member Submission; Alonso G., 2003, Web Services - Concepts, Architectures and Applications; Altenhofen M, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3785, P81; Alves A., 2007, Web Services Business Process Execution Language Version 2.0; Borger Egon., 2003, ABSTRACT STATE MACHI; Christensen E., 2001, WEB SERVICES DESCRIP; Curbera F., 2009, ENCY DATABASE SYSTEM, P413; Fensel D., 2002, ELECTRON COMMER R A, V1, P113, DOI [DOI 10.1016/S1567-4223(02)00015-7, 10.1016/S1567-4223(02)00015-7]; Fensel D., 2007, ENABLING SEMANTIC WE; Kozen D, 1997, ACM T PROGR LANG SYS, V19, P427, DOI 10.1145/256167.256195; Liu L., 2009, ENCY DATABASE SYSTEM, P266; Ma H., 2009, SERVICE ORIENTED COM, V3, P263; Ma H., 2012, SERVICE ORI IN PRESS; Ma H, 2009, 2009 IEEE ASIA-PACIFIC SERVICES COMPUTING CONFERENCE (APSCC 2009), P91, DOI 10.1109/WMWA.2009.26; Schewe KD, 2005, DATA KNOWL ENG, V54, P147, DOI 10.1016/j.datak.2004.08.005; Schewe KD, 2007, DATA KNOWL ENG, V62, P101, DOI 10.1016/j.datak.2006.07.007; Schewe KD, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6413, P76, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-16385-2_11; Schewe KD, 2009, WORLD WIDE WEB, V12, P27, DOI 10.1007/s11280-008-0055-z; Stollberg M, 2006, P CSWWS 2006	19	2	2	0	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA	1550-6002		978-0-7695-4833-3	INT CONF QUAL SOFTW			2012							158	166		10.1109/QSIC.2012.22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QSIC.2012.22			9	Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BCE12					2026-01-09	WOS:000309942600025

At the software architecture level, designers combine subsystems into complete systems using different techniques, e.g. "Architecture Description Languages" (ADLs). There exists a number of ADLs, each of which is specialized for one or more architectural styles. They are designed by different research groups with different goals in mind corresponding to their mental model on how software architecture can be expressed in the most efficient and elegant way. As a result, ADLs are not compatible with each other, so that it is difficult to present a homogeneous view of the software architecture of a system assembled from different components. This paper presents an approach how architectural styles can be combined using a concept of ADL-interchange.

In a computation phase the programs proceed independently and asynchronously until a barrier is reached. In a communication phase initiated by all programs having reached the barrier only messages between the programs are exchanged until normal processing can be continued. In this article we present a behavioural theory for BSP computations comprising an axiomatisation of the BSP model, the definition of a restricted class of concurrent abstract state machines, which we call BSP abstract state machines, and the proof that BSP abstract state machines capture BSP computations as defined by the axiomatisation. We illustrate the use of BSP abstract state machines on map-reduce. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract State Machines (ASMs) provide a mathematical framework for system modelling, while Model Checking is a technology for verification of system properties. Together, they form a powerful tool for checking systems. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a competitive model checking approach due to its ability to compactly encode BMC problems. In this paper, we present a method of applying ASP to BMC of ASMs. Given an ASM and a temporal property, we show how to efficiently translate the BMC problem for the ASM into a problem of answer set computation. Experimental results for our method using the answer set solvers SMODELS and CMODELS are also given.

This result is already stated in [5] with a very brief proof sketch. The present paper gives a detailed proof of the result. We represent hereditarily finite sets, which are the typical BGS ASM objects, by membership graphs of the transitive closure of the sets. Testing for equality between BGS objects can be done in linear time in our representation.

Turbo ASMs are viewed as black-boxes that can combine arbitrary many steps of one or more submachines into one big step. The intermediate steps of a turbo ASM axe not observable from outside. It is not even clear what exactly the intermediate steps axe, because the semantics of turbo ASMs is usually defined inductively along the call graph of the ASM and the structure of the rule bodies. The most important application of turbo ASMs are recursive algorithms. Such algorithms can directly be simulated on turbo ASMs without transforming them into multi-agent (distributed) ASMs. In this article we analyze the hidden intermediate steps of turbo ASMs and characterize them using PAR/SEQ trees. We also address the problem of the reserve in the presence of recursion and sequential composition. Turbo ASMs with return values are obtained by syntactic sugar.

Our logic builds upon the unifying logic introduced by Nanchen and Stark for reasoning about hierarchical (parallel) ASMs. Our main contribution to this regard is the handling of non-determinism (both bounded and unbounded) within the logical formalism. Moreover, we do this without sacrificing the completeness of the logic for statements about single steps of non-deterministic parallel ASMs, such as invariants of rules, consistency conditions for rules, or step-by-step equivalence of rules.

ETF (Eiffel Testing Framework) is a tool for generating code from an abstract grammar specification of user interface actions derived from the requirements document. Mathmodels extends the classical Eiffel contracting notation with the use of mathematical models (based on sets, sequences, relations, functions, bags). The Mathmodels library has immutable queries (for specifications) as well as relatively efficient mutable commands (for describing executable abstract state machines). Models are developed and validated using the industrial strength Eiffel IDE, and the use of these tools thus scale up to the development of large systems in a way that supports the derivation of specification models from requirements, and seamlessness between models and code.

In particular, we analyze the different types of functions in ASMs and deal with the problem of functions that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, functions that are shared between several agents, and derived functions. We revise the concepts of function definition, use in predicate, and use in computation accordingly, and show how definition-use paths art specified in these cases. Finally, we propose a model-checking based approach to derive automatically test cases satisfying a given set of data flow coverage criteria.

Smart contracts are programs or protocols embedded into the distributed ledgers and are used to automate agreements between parties of a blockchain. Smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks due to their immutable and public nature, thus, it is important to guarantee the correctness of contracts already at design-time in order to avoid catastrophic events and huge loss of money. In this paper, we investigate the usage of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method for the specification, validation and verification of Ethereum smart contracts. We present the ASM model of the Ethereum virtual machine, and we define a set of ASM libraries that simplify smart contracts modeling. We also provide models of malicious contracts in terms of ASM libraries that can be used to check if a given smart contract is vulnerable to a certain attack. As a proof of concept, we show our approach by exploiting the DAO smart contract and its vulnerability to a reentrancy attack.

Both these two approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and we here show how the advantages of one can be exploited to cover or weaken the disadvantages of the other. We also propose an in-the-loop integration which allows the development of a general framework for software engineering where rigorousness and preciseness of formal methods are combined with flexibility and automation of the MDE. We discuss the feasibility of unifying these two separate worlds, referring to our experience on integrating the Abstract State Machine formal method with the Eclipse Modeling Framework supporting MDE facilities.

Methods and techniques supporting rigorous formal design of system architecture where software components interact with each other and control physical components are highly demanded to assure reliability of the system operation. We present a formal model of the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3, the new standard of the European Rail Traffic Management System, aiming to replace the different national train control and command systems by a unique European railway management system. We use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method to provide a complete specification of the standard. The model has been developed through a sequence of model refinement steps following the incremental way in which requirements describe train operation. We have exploited the ASMETA tool-set supporting the ASMs to simulate the abstract models and validate them with respect to the operational scenarios that are given as part of the requirements. We discuss ambiguities and inconsistencies of the requirements, as well as difficulties encountered in the specification and during scenarios simulation.

It is based on a conceptual model and the use of search and ranking algorithms. The conceptual model is based on Abstract State Machine theory. Requirements for dynamic service mediation were derived from a real-world case. The conceptual model and the algorithms are developed and implemented by a proof of concept for this case. This model is build on existing means for sharing public services, which would enable migration of existing applications to our proposed approach. The conceptual model is compared to other models for service mediation to illustrate differences and identify similarities.

In particular, in a so-called blackhole attack, one or more malicious hosts can send fake routing information towards an initiator, compromising the reliability of the network in the whole. In this paper, we propose a refinement of the NACK-based Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (N-AODV) protocol, namely Blackhole-free N-AODV (BN-AODV), as a solution to intercept (cooperative) blackhole attacks in MANETs. Thanks to a formalization through an Abstract State Machine-based model, the correctness of the proposed protocol is formally proved.

Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. Previously, we have presented Asm2C++ [1] - a tool that translates Abstract State Machines (ASMs) to C++ code. In this paper, we extend the Asm2C(++) tool such that it can now automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the BOOST library. We also present some experiments that prove the feasibility of the proposed approach.

The ability to specify processes and to reason about them is central to these initiatives. In this paper we analyze the WSMO choreography model, which is based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and propose a methodology for generating WSMO choreography from visual specifications. We point out the limitations of the current WSMO model and propose a faithful extension that is based on Concurrent Transaction Logic (CTR). The advantage of a CTR-based model is that it uniformly captures a number of aspects that previously required separate mechanisms or were not captured at all. These include process specification, contracting for services, service enactment, and reasoning.

One important obstacle to achieving this goal is that executing rules may result in a clash, that aborts the ASM run. This paper contributes three results towards this goal. First, it shows that it is possible to compute a first-order formula for each rule that implies clash-freedom when provable. The derived formula is not a precise characterization, but is provable for many ASMs that are used in practice. Second, we give axioms that describe the transition relation for clash-free ASM rules as formulas of predicate logic that can be used to verify pre/post-condition assertions using automated theorem provers. Third, we show that the relational encoding can be used to justify a calculus for clash-free ASM rules based on symbolic execution. Such a calculus is useful for interactive theorem provers such as our tool KIV. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This process exploits concepts and technologies of the Model-driven Engineering (MDE) approach, such as metamodelling and automatic generation of software artifacts from models. We describe the requirements to fulfill and the development steps of this model-driven process. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the Finite State Machines and we report our experience in engineering a metamodel-based language and a toolset for the Abstract State Machine formal method.

In this paper an extension of Abstract State Machines by such expressions is introduced and its usefulness is demonstrated by examples of computations on graphs, such as graph factoring and checking self-similarity. In a naive way these high-level specifications can be refined using submachines for the evaluation of the higher-order expressions. We show that refinements can be obtained in an automatic way for well-defined fragments of higher-order logic that collapse to second-order, by means of which the naive refinement is only necessary for second-order logic expressions.

The method allows one to start system development with a trustworthy high level system specification and to link such a "ground model" in a well documented and inspectable way through intermediate design steps to its implementation. The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich's Abstract State Machines. Through its versatility the ASM approach is non-monolithic and integratable at any development level into current design and analysis environments. We also collect experimental evidence for the ASM thesis, a generalization of Turing's thesis.

This paper presents an extension for this cloud model which enables client-to-client interaction in an almost direct way, so that the involvement of cloud services is transparent to the users. The discussed solution for transparent use of services is a kind of switching service, where registered cloud users communicate with each other, and the only role the cloud plays is to switch resources from one client to another. We also show in an example at the end of this paper how our novel client-to-client interaction mechanism can be utilized for the development of the anonymously accessible cloud services.

Abstract State Machines as an Intermediate Representation for High-level Synthesis	2011 DESIGN, AUTOMATION & TEST IN EUROPE (DATE)	Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition		English	Proceedings Paper	Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE)	MAR 14-18, 2011	Grenoble, FRANCE	European Design & Automat Assoc, EDA Consortium, IEEE Council EDA, ECSI, ACM SIGDA, ACM SIGBED, IEEE Solid State Circuits Soc, IEEE Comp Soc, IFIP, Inst Engn Technol, RAS				This work presents a high-level synthesis methodology that uses the abstract state machines (ASMs) formalism as an intermediate representation (IR). We perform scheduling and allocation on this IR, and generate synthesizable VHDL. We have the following advantages when using ASMs as an IR: 1) it allows the specification of both sequential and parallel computation, 2) it supports an extension of a clean timing model based on an interpretation of the sequential semantics, and 3) it has well-defined formal semantics, which allows the integration of formal methods into the methodology. While we specify our designs using ASMs, we do not mandate this. Instead, one can create translators that convert the algorithmic specifications from C-like languages into their equivalent ASM specifications. This makes the hardware synthesis transparent to the designer. We experiment our methodology with examples of a FIR, microprocessor, and an edge detecteor. We synthesize these designs and validate our designs on an FPGA.

State Machines (ASM) are mathematically defined environment for high-level system design, verification and analysis. This paper presents a proposition of a hybrid approach to the specification, analysis and testing of grid middleware using ASM. This approach allows an easy integration of created specification of developed middleware with existing components of grid systems. The important advantage of this approach is an automatic generation of test procedures for the implementation, following the model-based testing approach. This allows a smooth transition from the specification to implementation stage, as well as investigation of features of specification and implementation, at every stage of their development. Also, we propose a software environment which implements the proposed approach. Its use in practice will help to create more reliable grid systems.

The state of an Abstract State Machine has two components: a behavioural state and a data state. The behavioural states are shown on a state diagram, whose transitions are labelled with an "event" and a B operation. The firing of a transition is synonymous with the occurrence of its associated event. We use a synchronous model of communication based on shared events which simultaneously change the state of each participating machine. The B operation associated with a transition generally has the form G double right arrow S, where a necessary condition for the transition to fire is that G is true, and where S describes any resulting changes in the data state of the Abstract Machine. The paper includes simple examples, the translation of Abstract State Machines to B Action Systems, the translation of Abstract State Machines into "primitive" Abstract State Machines which have only behavioural state, the parallel combination of high level Abstract State Machines, and short notes on choice and refinement.

Instead, our model checker [MC] SQUARE uses the Simulation capabilities of COREASM to build the state space, there by directly Supporting ASMs and circumventing a possible loss of expressiveness in a. translation process. This enables our approach to present. counterexamples and witnesses directly as sequences of ASM states and at the same time supports, the major features of COREASM like distributed ASMs, n-ary functions or extended rule forms.

The limits of the approach to cope with the size and the complexity of modern computer-based systems are felt when it comes to provide evidence of the trustworthiness of the entire system that has been built out of verified components. To achieve this task one has to experimentally validate or to mathematically verify the composition of the system. This reveals a gap between the finite state machine (FSM) view of model-checkable components and the architectural system view. In this paper we show how Abstract State Machines (ASM) can be used to fill this gap for both design and analysis, using a flexible concept of ASM component.

As such, they can perform arbitrary actions on arbitrary objects. Abstract State Machines (ASMs) work on a similar basis. Exploring their capabilities with respect to representing and executing S-BPM models strengthens the theoretical foundations of S-BPM, and thus, validity of S-BPM tools. Moreover it enables coherent intertwining of business process modeling with executing of S-BPM representations. In this contribution we introduce the framework and roadmap tackling the exploration of the ASM approach in the context of S-BPM. We also report the major result, namely the implementation of an executable workflow engine with an Abstract State Machine interpreter based on an existing abstract interpreter model for S-BPM (applying the ASM refinement concept). This workflow engine serves as a baseline and reference implementation for further language and processing developments, such as simulation tools, as it has been developed within the Open-S-BPM initiative.

A reliability model for Service Component Architectures	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Software reliability models; Service Component Architecture; Abstract State Machines	COORDINATION MODEL; SOFTWARE	Service-oriented applications are dynamically built by assembling existing, loosely coupled, distributed, and heterogeneous services. Predicting their reliability is very important to appropriately drive the selection and assembly of services, to evaluate design feasibility, to compare design alternatives, to identify potential failure areas and to maintain an acceptable reliability level under environmental extremes. This article presents a model for predicting reliability of a service-oriented application based on its architecture specification in the lightweight formal language SCA-ASM. The SCA-ASM component model is based on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method Abstract State Machines for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. The proposed method provides an automatic and compositional means for predicting reliability both at system-level and component-level by combining a reliability model for an SCA assembly involving SCA-ASM components, and a reliability model of an SCA-ASM component. It exploits ideas from architecture-based and path-based reliability Models.

As envisioned by the Models@run.time research community, the use of formal models at runtime are fundamental to address this challenge. In this paper, we explore the concept of ASM@run.time and put this definition into the context of the runtime enforcement technique to address the runtime assurance of software systems.

Apart from the usual language maintenance, SDL-2000 will offer new features for exception handling and object-oriented data types. To capture these features formally, a new formal SDL semantics is being devised. In several meetings of ITU-T SG10/Q6, the essential design objectives have been clarified, and an outline of the behaviour model for SDL has been presented and discussed. A major concern in this discussion has been the demand for an executable model, which calls for an operational formalism with readily available tool support. Subsequent investigations have shown that Abstract State Machines (ASMs) meet this and all other design objectives, and therefore have been chosen as the underlying formalism. In this paper, ASMs are applied to define the behaviour model of a sample SDL specification formally, thereby illustrating the approach in general.

In this paper some quality criteria are postulated and investigated by combining semi-formal and formal methods. On a high level of abstractions WISs can be described by abstract locations and transitions between them. These so-called story spaces can be formalised using Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which permit to verify, whether user-tailored versions are compatible with user preferences. Furthermore, ASMs provide a framework for refinement, which permits the integration of story spaces with extended views on databases. This leads to further proof obligations for consistency that can be formalised in the logic associated with ASMs.	Univ Kiel, Inst Appl Math & Sci Comp, D-24098 Kiel, Germany	University of Kiel	Binemann-Zdanowicz, A (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Appl Math & Sci Comp, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.	binemann@is.informatik.uni-kiel.de; k.d.schewe@massey.ac.nz; thalheim@is.informatik.uni-kiel.de; j.zhao@massey.ac.nz						[Anonymous], LNCS; [Anonymous], 2000, ACM Tran.

This formalism has been substantially revised in UML 2. Concepts like signal handling and interruptible activity regions were introduced. By using a token flow semantics for describing the execution, activities drift apart from state diagrams. Therefore, it is no more possible to apply verification techniques designed for state diagrams to activity diagrams. This problem is faced by introducing a transformation of activities into a state transition system covering the basic concepts of activity diagrams including but not limited to the aforementioned ones.

To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (ITS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose). Finally, the verified transformation is mechanized in the theorem prover Coq. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Following this idea, in this paper, we propose an approach for incrementally verifying the dynamic semantics specified with abstract state machines (ASMs), such that definitions of previous versions must not be altered in subsequent versions. As a result, the compiler can be verified incrementally without revising the proofs of previous versions. As our first step, in this paper, we formalize and verify the memory mapping of the initial versions with ASMs and discuss their extensibility for the next increments. We plan to demonstrate this approach through the agile implementation and verification of a Sather-K compiler generating MIPS assembly language.

However, these standards establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper presents a formal development process, based on the Abstract State Machine method, that integrates most of the activities required by the standards. The process permits to obtain, through a sequence of refinements, more detailed models that can be formally validated and verified. Offline and online testing techniques permit to check the conformance of the implementation w.r.t. the specification. The process is applied to the validation of the SAM medical software, that is used to measure the patients' stereoacuity in the diagnosis of amblyopia.

A scenario of a potential attack specifies the flow but not the content of messages. Using scenarios can reduce the number of protocol runs to be explored during attack searching via simulation. The number of runs can be further reduced by minimizing the number of intruder's generated messages. The intruder's ability to generate messages is limited by considering: the expected message content and type matching. Our approach uses two tools that support the Abstract State Machines method: the AsmetaL for modelling purposes and the AsmetaS for performing the simulation. We propose a simple model for the specification of commutative encryption. Several protocols are examined to show the effectiveness of our method.

We prove the correctness property that concurrent runs under the transaction controller are serialisable, assuming an Inverse Operation Postulate to guarantee recoverability. For its applicability to a wide range of programs we specify the transaction controller TACTL and the operator TA in terms (o)f Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This allows us to model concurrent updates at different levels of nested locations in a precise yet simple manner, namely in terms of partial ASM updates. It also provides the possibility to use the controller TACTL and the operator TA as a plug-in when specifying concurrent system components in terms of sequential ASMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of a (self-stabilizing) infrastructure such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system for their execution. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this article, we present our design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler. The compiler we designed and implemented transforms programs written in a language similar to the abstract state machine (ASM). The compiler preserves the stabilization property of the high level program.

The SASL was originally specified in RFC 2222, and later updated in RFC 4422, using natural language. However, due to the richness of natural language this involves ambiguities and imprecision. Whilst there is an Oracle implementation of SASL, its documentation also contains informal descriptions and under-defined specifications of the RFCs. This paper provides clarification of ambiguity in SASL using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This clarification is based on two ASM essential notions: a ground model to capture the intended SASL behavior in an understandable way, and a refinement notion to accurately explicate the ambiguous parts of the behavior. We also show some differences between RFCs and the description of the Oracle implementation. We believe our work can serve as a basis for further implementation and for formal analysis.

If models are executable, as for state-based formal specifications, engines to orchestrate the simulation of separate component operational models are extremely useful. This paper presents an approach for the co-simulation, according to predefined orchestration schemas, of state-based models of separate components of a Discrete Event System. More precisely, we exploit the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method as state-based formalism, and we (i) define a set of operators to compose ASMs that communicate with each other through I/O events, and (ii) present an engine to execute the compositional simulation of the ASMs as a whole assembly. As proof of concepts, we use a set of model examples of Discrete Event Systems of increasing complexity to show the application of our approach and to evaluate its effectiveness in co-simulating models of real systems.

Predicting their reliability is important to appropriately drive the selection and assembly of services. This paper presents an approach to predict the reliability of a service component architecture. We adopt a lightweight formal component model, SCA-ASM, as core modeling technique for both architecture and behavior, supported by a run-time platform. This component model is based on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method Abstract State Machines for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. The proposed reliability prediction method exploits ideas from architecture-based and path-based reliability models.

They are deployed across large distributed systems and require a robust infrastructure. Their complex structure has been addressed numerous times in practice, but rarely in a formal manner. We propose in this paper a formal modeling approach for monitoring traffic systems and identifying possible failures of traffic sensors. Ensuring a safe and robust deployment and execution of services implies having a clear view on the system status, which is analysed by the monitoring framework. Our work focuses on availability aspects and makes use of the Abstract State Machines modeling technique for specifying the solution. The framework is defined as an Abstract State Machine agent and simulated in the ASMETA tool.

J	Cavarra, A				Cavarra, Alessandra			A data-flow approach to test multi-agent ASMs	FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING			English	Article						Model-based testing; Data-flow analysis; Abstract state machines		This paper illustrates the theoretical basis of an approach to apply data flow testing techniques to abstract state machines (ASMs). In particular, we focus on multi-agent ASMs extended with the seq construct for turbo ASMs. We explain why traditional data flow analysis can not simply be applied to ASMs: data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph whereas in this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph. We revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis taking into account the specific, parallel nature of ASMs, and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. In particular, we analyze the role played by different types of terms in ASMs and deal with the problem of terms that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, terms that are shared between several agents, and derived terms. We also discuss what consequences the use of the turbo ASM construct seq has on our analysis and revise the approach accordingly. Finally, we specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria for this class of ASMs and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.

They should abstract irrelevant details and provide a precise and complete description of the behaviour of the system. This view of software specification can naturally be expressed by means of Gurevich's Abstract State Machines (ASMs). There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi) automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We describe, in the form of examples, an abstraction process which starts by extracting an initial ground-level ASM specification from Java source code (with the same core functionality), and ends in a high-level ASM specification at the desired level of abstraction. We argue that this process can be done in a (semi) automated way, resulting in a valuable tool to improve the current software engineering practices.

The code generation process follows the model-driven engineering approach, where the code is obtained from a formal abstract model by applying certain transformation rules. The translation process is highly configurable in order to correctly integrate the underlying hardware. The advantage of the Asm2C++ tool is that it is part of the Asmeta framework that allows to analyze, verify, and validate the correctness of a formal model.

In order to provide the necessary confidence level, with regard to the respect of functional and non-functional properties, a system analysis that accounts for all possible execution paths must be performed. Symbolic execution has been successfully used to explore and analyze reachable system states. In this paper, we formally define a symbolic execution semantics for an abstract state machine based model. The unification of the update semantics redefined in terms of symbolic moves, enable us to achieve reacher methods for path condition resolution and ultimately better scalability of the execution. The goal of this paper is to provide a formal ground for the integration of symbolic execution in existing timing analysis frameworks based on abstract state machines that will facilitate the computability of the analysis tools.

There exist several techniques for test generation, which, however, may suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we assume that the system under test can be divided in several subsystems such that only one subsystem is active at the time. Moreover, each subsystem decides when and to which other subsystem to pass the control, by also initializing the initial state of the next subsystem in a desired way. We model these systems and we show how it is possible to generate tests in a very efficient way that exploits the division of the entire system in subsystems. Test generation for the whole system is performed by visiting each subsystem and generating tests for it. The tests are combined in order to obtain valid system traces. We show how several visiting policies influence the completeness of the test generation process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The central idea is to enable some low-level conflicts to be ignored by taking higher-level application semantics into account. In this paper, we approach the formal specification of a multi-level transaction scheduler using Abstract State Machines. We are particularly interested in showing that concrete pmtocols for multi-level transaction processing arise as refinements of an abstract ground model specification. Furthermore, we are interested in the proof of desirable properties of such schedulers such as the correctness and if possible also completeness with respect to serialisability, and the recoverability of the accepted schedules. For this we investigate a two-phase locking and a hybrid protocol.

Our logic builds upon the unifying logic introduced by Nanchen and Stark for reasoning about hierarchical (parallel) ASMs. Our main contribution is the handling of non-determinism within the logical formalism. We do this without sacrificing the completeness of the logic for statements about single steps of non-deterministic and parallel ASMs, such as invariants of rules, consistency conditions for rules, or step-by-step equivalence of rules. Moreover, we show that the proposed one-step logic can be easily extended to a multiple-step logic which enables reasoning about concurrent ASMs.	[Ferrarotti, Flavio; Schewe, Klaus-Dieter; Tec, Loredana] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Wang, Qing] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia	Softwarepark Hagenberg; Australian National University	Ferrarotti, F (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria.	flavio.ferrarotti@scch.at; kd.schewe@scch.at; loredana.tec@scch.at; qing.wang@anu.edu.au		Ferrarotti, Flavio/0000-0003-2278-8233; Wang, Qing/0000-0001-9504-4273	Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P26452-N15, I2420-N31]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) through the COMET; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2420] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)	Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) through the COMET; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))	The research reported in this paper results from the projects Behavioral Theory and Logics for Distributed Adaptive Systems and Higher-Order Logics and Structures supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF: [P26452-N15] & [I2420-N31]).

This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of these classes of algorithms. In a companion paper [5] the axiomatisation was extended to cover interactive small-step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary. This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment's replies but also the order in which the replies were received. In order to prove the thesis for algorithms of this generality, we extend here the definition of abstract state machines to incorporate explicit attention to the relative timing of replies and to the possible absence of replies. We prove the characterization theorem for extended ASMs with respect to general algorithms as axiomatised in [5].

We formalise this problem by the notion of the greatest consistent specialisation (GCS) adapting and generalising this 20 year old concept to sequential Abstract State Machines (ASMs) with emphasis on bounded parallelism. In a state satisfying I such that P is repairable the notion of consistent specialisation will require an enlargement of the update set, which defines a partial order with respect to which a GCS is defined. We show that GCSs are compositional in two respects: (1) the GCS of an ASM with a complex rule can be obtained from the GCSs of the involved assignments, and (2) the GCS with respect to a set of invariants can be built using the GCSs for the individual invariants in the set.

There are ways to extend the abstract state machine (ASM) framework with distribution aspects, but there is no unifying framework for handling time so far. We propose event structures extended with time as a natural framework for representing state machines and their true concurrency model at a semantic level and for discussing associated time models. Constraints on these timed event structures and their traces (runs) are then used for characterising different frameworks for timed computations. This characterisation of timed frameworks is independent of ASM and allows to compare time models of different modelling formalisms. Finally, we propose some specific extensions of ASM for the expressions of time constraints in accordance with the event-based semantic framework and show the applicability of the obtained framework on an example with a standard time model and a set of consistency properties for timed computations.

J	Schellhorn, G				Schellhorn, Gerhard			Completeness of fair ASM refinement	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th Refinement Workshop	MAY 27, 2008	Turku, FINLAND	British Comp Soc (BCS)		Refinement; Completeness; Abstract state machines; IO automata; Abadi-Lamport; Fairness	LOGICAL OPERATIONAL SEMANTICS; SIMULATIONS	ASM refinements are verified using generalized forward simulations which allow us to refine m abstract operations to n concrete operations with arbitrary m and n. One main difference from data refinement is that ASM refinement considers infinite runs and termination. Since backward simulation does not preserve termination in general, the standard technique of adding history information to the concrete level is not applicable to get a completeness proof. The power set construction also adds infinite runs and is therefore not applicable either. This paper shows that a completeness proof is nevertheless possible by adding infinite prophecy information, effectively moving nondeterminism to the initial state. Adding such prophecy information can be done not only on the semantic level, but also by a simple syntactic transformation that removes the choose construct of ASMs. The completeness proof is also translated to a completeness proof for IO automata. Finally, the proof is extended to deal with supplementary predicates, that specify fairness and liveness assumptions, by transferring a related result of Wim Hesselink for refinements that use the Abadi-Lamport setting.

The message passing paradigm is used more often due to the lesser hardware requirements. MPI is a standardized message passing API with several independent implementations. Specification and verification of distributed systems is generally a challenging task. In this paper we present a case study of specification and verification of MPI based software using abstract state machines (ASMs).

Formal verification of ASMs using MDGs	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						formal verification; abstract state machines; multiway decision graphs; model checking		We present a framework for the formal verification of abstract state machine (ASM) designs using the multiway decision graphs (MDG) tool. ASM is a state based language for describing transition systems. MDG provides symbolic representation of transition systems. with support of abstract sorts and functions. We implemented a transformation tool that automatically generates MDG models from ASM specifications. Then formal verification techniques provided by the MDG tool, such as model checking or equivalence checking, can be applied on the generated models. We illustrate this work with the case study of an ATM switch controller, in which behavior and structure were specified in ASM and, using our ASM-MDG facility, are successfully verified with the MDG tool.

The notion of test goal is introduced as a state predicate denoting the detection condition for a particular fault. Tests are generated by forcing a model checker to produce counter examples which cover the test goals. We introduce a technique for the evaluation of the fault detection capability of a test set. We report some experimental results which validate the method, compare the fault adequacy criteria with some classical structural coverage criteria and show an empirical cross coverage among faults.

We provide a complete embedding of PSL in the ASM language AsmL, which allows us to integrate PSL properties as a part of the design. For verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the code containing both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage of the AsmL language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both C# code and FSMs from AsmL models. We applied our approach on the PCI-X bus standard, which AsmL model was constructed from the informal standard specifications and a subsequent UML model. Experimental results on the PCI-X bus case study showed a superiority of our approach to conventional verification.

J	Bombarda, A; Bonfanti, S; Gargantini, A				Bombarda, Andrea; Bonfanti, Silvia; Gargantini, Angelo			Integrating formal specifications in the development and testing of UIs by formal model-view-controller pattern	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER			English	Article; Early Access						Model-view-controller; Abstract state machines; Asmeta; Model-based testing		Ensuring software functionality, maintainability, and modularity is vital while developing UIs. For this reason, architectural patterns, like the Model-View-Controller (MVC), are usually employed. The MVC aims to separate the representation of information (model) from its presentation to the user (view). One can use a formal model to study the system and the UI, but such formal models are separately developed and analyzed, and the results of the analysis cannot be assured for the actual implementation. To address this problem, we introduced the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), allowing the integration of Asmeta specifications into the model of the MVC-designed software. This paper extends the fMVC pattern and the framework to better support Java Swing components and enhance error management, including automatic model state rollback on input failure. Moreover, we propose an extension enabling testers to generate and reuse Avalla scenarios for UI validation. We demonstrate the framework's application, covering modeling, validation, and verification at the model level for the AMAN case study that inspired us during the definition of the fMVC pattern. Moreover, we show how the AMAN UI can be implemented and tested by our approach.

J	Glässer, U; Gotzhein, R; Prinz, A				Glässer, U; Gotzhein, R; Prinz, A			The formal semantics of SDL-2000:: Status and perspectives	COMPUTER NETWORKS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING			English	Article						SDL; distributed systems; system design; formal semantics; abstract state machines		In November 1999, the current version of specification and description language (SDL), commonly referred to as SDL-2000, passed through ITU-T. In November 2000, the formal semantics of SDL- 2000 was officially approved to become part of the SDL language definition. It covers both the static and the dynamic semantics, and is based on the formalism of abstract state machines (ASMs). To support executability, the formal semantics defines, for each SDL specification, reference ASM code, which enables an SDL-to-ASM-compiler. In this paper, we briefly survey and compare existing approaches to define the semantics of SDL formally. The ITUT approach is then outlined in more detail, addressing the following steps: (1) mapping of non-basic language constructs to the core language, (2) checking of static semantics conditions, (3) definition of the SDL abstract machine (SAM), and (4) definition of the SDL virtual machine (SVM). The paper concludes with experiences from the SDL-to-ASM-compiler project. It is proposed that the SDL-2000 semantics can be adapted and extended to formally define the meaning of UML 2.0 class, composite structure, and statechart diagrams. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The definition takes care to reflect directly and faithfully-as much as possible without becoming inconsistent or incomplete-the descriptions in the Q standard to become comparable with the corresponding models for Java in Stark et al. (Java and Java Virtual Machine-Definition, Verification, Validation, Springer, Berlin, 2001) and to provide for implementors the possibility to check their basic design decisions against an accurate high-level model. The model sheds light on some of the dark corners of Q and on some critical differences between the ECMA standard and the implementations of the language.

However, many formal methods rely on a refinement-based development process which poses problems for their integration into agile processes. We consider redundancies within refinement hierarchies as a challenge for the practical application of stepwise refinement and propose superimposition-based modularization of refinement steps as a potential solution. While traditionally, each model in a refinement hierarchy must be developed and maintained separately, our concept allows developers to specify the refinement steps that transform a model into a refined one. We have developed tool support for the language AsmetaL and evaluated our approach by means of a case study. The results indicate a reduction of complexity for the development artifacts in terms of their overall size by 48.6% for the ground model and four refinements. Furthermore, the case study shows that superimposition-based refinement eases the development of alternative refinements for exploratory development and to cope with changing requirements. Thus, we consider this work as a step towards agile formal methods that are tailored to support iterative development, facilitating their incorporation into agile development processes.

With the increasing interest research on understanding the mechanisms and processes through which learning occurs in FLOSS, there is an imperative to describe these processes. One successful way of doing this is through specification methods. In this paper, we describe the adoption of Abstract States Machines (ASMs) as a specification methodology for the description of learning processes in FLOSS. The goal of this endeavor is to represent the many possible steps and/or activities FLOSS participants go through during interactions that can be categorized as learning processes. Through ASMs, we express learning phases as states while activities that take place before moving from one state to another are expressed as transitions.

Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation. Furthermore this includes the automatic generation of the associated traceability data and test specification documentation. An initial framework has been defined to support exchangeability of individual tasks in the generation toolchain. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by testing the complete heterogeneous signal communication of an exemplary avionics system, resp. platform instance, at system level as well as at software high-level.

These systems often have stringent real-time requirements. This paper presents an extension to AADL's behavior model using time annotations in order to improve the evaluation of timing properties in AADL. The translational semantics of this extension is based on mappings to the Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM) language. As a result, timing analysis with timed simulation or timed model checking is possible. The translation is supported by art Eclipse-based plug-in and the approach is validated with a case study of an industrial production cell system.

As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data used in OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to dialogue interfaces for OLAP. In the paper we describe how abstract state machines (ASMs) can be used to design OLAP systems. Based on the idea of separating input from output we model a ground model ASM for OLAP and discuss system quality by reasoning about this model.

The type-2 theory of effectivity (TTE) is a well established theory of computability on infinite strings, which can be used to represent real numbers by rapidly converging Cauchy sequences, on top of which standard operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc. can be defined. In this paper we develop an extension of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) handling streams in an incremental way in accordance with TTE. This enables defining a data type Real as part of the background structure and based on this exact computation with real numbers. Output can be generated at any degree of precision by exploring only sufficiently long prefixes of the representing Cauchy sequences. We then outline an ASM development process that starts from a specification of an algorithm using Real, proceeds by making the rational elements of the Cauchy sequences explicit in a refinement, reconsiders this refined specification as a concurrent ASM, where each agent cares about computation up to some precision, and finally, based on a detailed analysis of the required precision, prunes the concurrent ASM down to an ASM that guarantees a sufficient level of precision in the outputs. In doing so, backward precision propagation replaces the common forward error propagation that is common for implementations exploiting floating point arithmetic. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes rules for formal modelling of IEC61499 function blocks for popular model checking environment of SMV using Abstract State Machines as an intermediate model. This paper first proposes a formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The formal description for main artifact of the standard (function block) is presented in the paper. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model checker which is used to formally verify properties of applications developed in IEC 61499 standard. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the formal verification of the IEC 61499 control systems. The paper also highlights the other uses of verification such as portability of IEC 61499 based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The formal model is applied on an example IEC 61499 controller, and the SMV model for the Basic Function block is explained in detail.

Many programming languages allow some non-determinism for evaluating expressions. The semantics only have in common that arguments are evaluated before an operator is applied. The evaluation of one argument may be interleaved with the evaluation of the other arguments. However, programming languages usually restrict this most liberal evaluation order. For example, the expression evaluation may take into account short-circuit evaluation of boolean expressions which implies that right operands must not be evaluated before the complete left operand is evaluated. Our approach provides a generic expression evaluation semantics that only need to be instantiated adequatly. We demonstrate this approach by the example of Ada95, C, C++, Java, C#, and Fortran.

The construction of an ASM model for the basic S-BPM concepts revealed a strong relation between S-BPM and the ASM method for software design and analysis. In this paper we investigate this relation more closely. We use the analysis to evaluate S-BPM as an approach to business process modeling and to suggest some challenging practical extension of the S-BPM system.

The standard aims at the portability of control applications that is however hampered by ambiguities in its execution semantics descriptions. In recent years several execution models have been implemented in different software tools that generate mutually incompatible code. This paper proposes a general approach to neutralizing these semantic ambiguities by formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The model embodies all known execution semantics of function blocks. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model-checker which is used to verify formally properties of applications. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the portability checking of component-based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The paper first discusses different existing execution semantics of function blocks and the portability issues across different IEC 61499 tools. Then a modular formal model of function blocks' operational semantics in ASM is introduced and exemplified in the paper by the cyclic execution semantics case for a composite function block. Subsequently, the SMV model is generated and model-checking is illustrated for a simple test case.

Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant financial losses. This paper introduces a method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The approach models a smart contract as an Abstract State Machine (ASM), where the absence of specific vulnerabilities is encoded as invariants. An existing symbolic execution technique for ASM models was extended and improved to enable the processing of the ASM models of the smart contracts. By symbolically executing the ASM, the method identifies faulty execution paths that violate these invariants, exposing potential vulnerabilities in the contract's behavior. Vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart contract can be generated using the symbolic execution results. As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running case study, the Auction smart contract. Furthermore, we discuss the results of applying the technique to a number of Solidity smart contracts.

J	Paulweber, P; Simhandl, G; Zdun, U				Paulweber, Philipp; Simhandl, Georg; Zdun, Uwe			On the Understandability of Language Constructs to Structure the State and Behavior in Abstract State Machine Specifications: A Controlled Experiment	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Abstract State Machines; Empirical software engineering; Understandability; Language constructs; Controlled experiment	STATISTICS	State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known state-based formal method to analyze and specify software and hardware systems. As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed modeling languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to structure state and behavior aspects of specifications. Modern object-oriented languages offer a variety of advanced language constructs, and most of them either offer interfaces, mixins, or traits in addition to classes and inheritance. Our goal is to investigate these language constructs in the context of state-based formal methods using ASMs as a representative of this kind of formal methods. We report on a controlled experiment with 105 participants to study the understandability of the three language constructs in the context of ASMs. Our hypotheses are influenced by the debate of object-oriented communities. We hypothesized that the understandability (measured by correctness and duration variables) shows significantly better understanding for interfaces and traits compared to mixins, as well as at least a similar or better understanding for traits compared to interfaces. The results indicate that understandability of interfaces and traits show a similar good understanding, whereas mixins shows a poorer understanding. We found a significant difference for the correctness of understanding comparing interfaces with mixins. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users' requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service and costs. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, failures and misbehavior. The role of the monitoring and adaptation components is essential in understanding failures of the system and reconfiguring it to a stable state based on the available information. We propose in this paper a distributed monitoring and adaptation solution responsible for identifying failures of the components and building recovery plans. The focus of the paper is to capture the nonfunctional and functional properties of the monitoring and adaptation layers in a formal model. We employ the rigorous Abstract State Machine method to build the control state diagram and define the ground model. We follow a formal approach using ASMETA toolset for defining the correct behavior of the components.

J	Gurevich, Y; Tillmann, N				Gurevich, Y; Tillmann, N			Partial updates	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						abstract state machines; applicative algebra; AsmL; parallel composition; sequences; transactions; updates		A datastructure instance, e.g. a set or file or record, may be modified independently by different parts of a computer system. The modifications may be nested. Such hierarchies of modifications need to be efficiently checked for consistency and integrated. This is the problem of partial updates in a nutshell. In our first paper on the subject, we developed an algebraic framework which allowed us to solve the partial update problem for some useful datastructures including counters, sets and maps. These solutions are used for the efficient implementation of concurrent data modifications in the specification language AsmL. The two main contributions of this paper are (i) a more general algebraic framework for partial updates and (ii) a solution of the partial update problem for sequences and labeled ordered trees.

J	Cicchetti, A; Di Ruscio, D				Cicchetti, Antonio; Di Ruscio, Davide			Decoupling web application concerns through weaving operations	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article						abstract state machines; model transformations; model weaving; web applications; metamodel specification	TRANSFORMATION; METAMODEL	Today's Web applications require instruments and techniques able to face their complexity which has noticeably increased at the expense of productivity and quality factors. A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the "everything is a model" principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or WebML. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

S-BPM Process Models are directly executable and formal execution semantics enable different software development teams to develop S-BPM engines with equivalent execution behavior. We did a state of the art analysis of existing formal S-BPM execution semantics and analyzed the required language elements of an advanced smart energy grid Process Model. We extended an existing Abstract State Machines (ASM) specification to close the identified specification gaps. To foster the understanding of the specification details, we developed a specification conform reference implementation by using the executable CoreASM language and execution tool, developed a console application as CoreASM user interface, designed test models and used them to evaluate the contribution.

Correct operation of a medical device depends upon the controlling software, whose development should adhere to certification standards. However, these standards provide general descriptions of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding particular methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper discusses how to integrate the use of a formal approach into the current normative for the medical software development. The rigorous process is based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method, its refinement principle, and model analysis approaches the method supports. The hemodialysis machine case study is used to show how the ASM-based design process covers most of the engineering activities required by the related standards, and provides rigorous approaches for medical software validation and verification.

We report our experience in modeling the automotive case study from the ABZ2020 conference using the ASMETA toolset, based on the Abstract State Machine formal method. We adopted a seamless system engineering method: from an incremental formal specification of high-level requirements to increasingly refined ASMETA models, to the C++ code generation from the model. Along this process, different validation and verification activities were performed. We explored modeling styles and idioms to face the modeling complexity and ensure that the ASMETA models can best capture and reflect specific behavioral patterns.

The target environment consists of very heterogeneous and partly low-power devices. It changes rapidly due to wireless communication and mobile users. We propose to use model-driven development based on Abstract State Machines to deal with these challenges. Applications are defined on high levels of abstraction and efficient implementations tailored to the target platform are automatically generated.

By continuity, the value of the functional on a given function depends only on a "critical" finite part of this function. Care: there is in general no way to compute this critical finite part without querying the function on an arbitrarily larger finite part! Nevertheless, things are different in case there is a uniform bound on the size of the domain of this critical finite part. We prove that, modulo a quadratic blow-up of the bound, one can compute the value of the functional by an algorithm which queries the input function on a uniformly bounded finite part. Up to a constant factor, this quadratic blow-up is optimal. We also characterize such functionals in topological terms using uniformities. As an application of these results, we get a topological characterization of the dynamics of algorithms as modeled by Gurevich's Abstract State Machines.

In the present work, we describe, by means of suitable postulates, those interactive algorithms that (1) proceed in discrete, global steps; (2) perform only a bounded amount of work in each step; (3) use only such information from the environment as can be regarded as answers to queries; and (4) never complete a step until all queries from that step have been answered. We indicate how a great many sorts of interaction meet these requirements. We also discuss in detail the structure of queries and replies and the appropriate definition of equivalence of algorithms. Finally, motivated by our considerations concerning queries, we discuss a generalization of first-order logic in which the arguments of function and relation symbols are not merely tuples of elements but orbits of such tuples under groups of permutations of the argument places.

J	Riccobene, E; Scandurra, P				Riccobene, Elvinia; Scandurra, Patrizia			A formal framework for service modeling and prototyping	FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING			English	Article						Service formal modeling; Service model prototyping; Service Component Architecture; Abstract State Machines	INTERACTION PATTERNS; COMPONENTS; CALCULUS; LANGUAGE	Service-oriented Computing is rapidly gaining importance across several application domains due to its capability of composing autonomous and loosely-coupled services. In order to support the engineering of service-oriented software applications, foundational theories, service modeling notations, evaluation techniques fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach are required. This article introduces a framework for modeling and prototyping service-oriented applications. The framework consists of a precise and executable language, SCA-ASM, for model-based design, and of a tool for early and quick design evaluation of service assemblies. The language combines the OASIS/OSOA standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) capability of modeling and assembling heterogeneous service-oriented components in a technology agnostic way, with the rigor of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method able to model notions of service behavior, interactions, orchestration, compensation and context-awareness in an abstract but executable way. The tool is based on existing execution environments for ASM models and SCA applications. An SCA-ASM model of a service-oriented component, possibly not yet implemented in code or available as off-the-shelf, can be (i) simulated and evaluated offline, i.e. in isolation from the other components; or (ii) executed as abstract implementation (or prototype) together with the other components implementations according to the chosen SCA assembly.

J	Blass, A; Gurevich, Y				Blass, Andreas; Gurevich, Yuri			Ordinary interactive small-step algorithms, III	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC			English	Article						algorithms; theory; sequential algorithms; interaction; postulates; equivalence of algorithms; abstract state machines		This is the third in a series of three articles extending the proof of the Abstract State Machine thesis-that arbitrary algorithms are behaviorally equivalent to abstract state machines-to algorithms that can interact with their environments during a step, rather than only between steps. As in the first two articles of the series, we are concerned here with ordinary, small-step, interactive algorithms. This means that the algorithms: (1) proceed in discrete, global steps, (2) perform only a bounded amount of work in each step, (3) use only such information from the environment as can be regarded as answers to queries, and (4) never complete a step until all queries from that step have been answered. After reviewing the previous articles' definitions of such algorithms, of behavioral equivalence, and of abstract state machines (ASMs), we prove the main result: Every ordinary, interactive, small-step algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to an ASM. We also discuss some possible variations of and additions to the ASM semantics.

In the course of the design and the extension of an executable specification language based on the Abstract State Machines formalism we recently performed a user survey. The question, how new language features are comprehended, remains unsolved. The main emphasis of this study is on eye gaze behavior of participants learning language features. Eye-tracking experiments were performed in two different countries using a Pupil Labs eye-tracking headset. An example specification and simple comprehension tasks were used as stimuli. The preliminary results of the eye-gaze behaviour analysis reveal that the new language feature was undestood well, but the new abstractions were frequently confused by participants. The foreknowledge of specific programming concepts is crucial how these abstractions are comprehended. More research is needed to infer this knowledge from viewing patterns.

Formal Semantics of Interactions in Sequence Diagrams for Embedded Software	2013 IEEE CONFERENCE ON OPEN SYSTEMS (ICOS)	IEEE Conference on Open Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Open Systems (ICOS)	DEC 02-04, 2013	Kuching, MALAYSIA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Technol Malaysia, IEEE Comp Soc Malaysia Sect		UML; sequence diagrams; abstract state machines; embedded software; distributed systems; formal methods		Recently, sequence diagrams have been extended with the introduction of a set of operators in the latest specification of the Unified Modeling Language 2 (UML 2). Embedded in combined fragments, these operators are intended to simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of its events. However, the latest specification introduces a non-trivial degree of ambiguity in the interpretation and understanding of sequence diagrams. As these diagrams are increasingly adopted as modeling tools in embedded software, their ambiguity can exacerbate the challenges encountered in embedded system design. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of the loop, break and strict operators in sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and their related constraints.

We present the design for an intelligent decision support system that employs these characteristics: it works through a collaborative, self-organizing network of intelligent agents. Developed for the realm of Marine Safety and Security, the goal of the system is to assist in the management of a complex array of resources in both a routine and emergency role. Notably, this system must be able to handle a dynamic environment and the existence of uncertainty. The decentralized control structure of a collaborative self-organizing system reinforces its adaptiveness, robustness and scalability in critical situations.

We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. The process has been used to validate our model-to-code transformations.

J	Blass, A; Gurevich, Y				Blass, Andreas; Gurevich, Yuri			Ordinary interactive small-step algorithms, II	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC			English	Article						algorithms; theory; sequential algorithms; interaction; postulates; equivalence of algorithms; abstract state machines		This is the second in a series of three articles extending the proof of the Abstract State Machine Thesis-that arbitrary algorithms are behaviorally equivalent to abstract state machines-to algorithms that can interact with their environments during a step, rather than only between steps. As in the first article of the series, we are concerned here with ordinary, small-step, interactive algorithms.,This means that the algorithms: (1) proceed in discrete, global steps, (2) perform only a bounded amount of work in each step, (3) use only such information from the environment as can be regarded as answers to queries, and (4) never complete a step until all queries from that step have been answered. After reviewing the previous article's formal description of such algorithms and the definition of behavioral equivalence, we define ordinary, interactive, small-step abstract state machines (ASMs). Except for very minor modifications, these are the machines commonly used in the ASM literature. We define their semantics in the framework of ordinary algorithms and show that they satisfy the postulates for these algorithms. This material lays the groundwork for the final article in the series, in which we shall prove the Abstract State Machine thesis for ordinary, intractive, small-step algorithms: All such algorithms are equivalent to ASMs.	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA	University of Michigan System; University of Michigan	Blass, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.	ablass@umich.edu; gurevich@microsoft.com						[Anonymous], 2000, ACM Tran.

Manually converting formal models into code poses challenges such as increased costs, limitations in specification reuse, and the potential for introducing errors. To overcome these limitations, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches enable developers to generate software code automatically. This paper proposes the Asmeta2Java tool for the automatic translation of formal Asmeta specifications into executable Java code. The designers start at an abstract level and perform refinement steps and verification activities. At the end, they automatically generates the code by applying the model-to-code transformation. Moreover, a process to validate and evaluate the transformation is presented.

The survey covers the period from 1984, when the idea for the concept of ASMs ( under the name dynamic or evolving algebras or structures) appears for the first time in a foundational context, to the year 2001 where a mathematically well-founded, practical system development method based upon the not on of ASMs is in place and ready to be industrially deployed. Some lessons for the future of ASMs are drawn.

J	Börger, E; Schulte, W				Börger, E; Schulte, W			A practical method for specification and analysis of exception handling -: A Java/JVM case study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						semantics; exception handling; compiler; correctness; Java; Java Virtual Machine; abstract state machines		In this paper, we provide a rigorous framework for language and platform independent design and analysis of exception handling mechanisms in modern programming languages and their implementations. To illustrate the practicality of the method we develop it for the exception handling mechanism of Java and show that its implementation on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is correct. For this purpose we define precise abstract models for exception handling in Java and in the JVM and define a compilation scheme of Java to JVM code which allows us to prove that, in corresponding runs, Java and the JVM throw the same exceptions and with equivalent effect.

To help software developers design a correct UML model for a software system has become an important goal for many UML CASE tools. In this paper, we propose a new UML virtual machine based on Abstract State Machines. We combine the UML meta-model, UML model and user objects model into one under the ASM virtual machine for UML. Since the ASM virtual machine for UML supports OCL, software developers can precisely design a software model and then find some errors such as inconsistency in the model with the help of the ASM virtual machine.

We discuss a number of related issues and, in particular, whether algorithms can be proved equivalent directly.

J	Braghin, C; Lilli, M; Riccobene, E				Braghin, Chiara; Lilli, Mario; Riccobene, Elvinia			A model-based approach for vulnerability analysis of IoT security protocols: The Z-Wave case study *	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Z -Wave protocol; IoT security; MITM; Formal verification; Abstract state machines; ASMETA		IoT (Internet of Things) devices are extensively used in security-critical services, as for example home door opening, gas monitoring, alarm systems, etc. Often, they use communication protocols with no stan-dardisation and no security guarantee. Unsecured use of connected devices can cause threats or damages to the users, so security assurance, which can be ensured by the use of formal methods, must be guar-anteed. Unfortunately practical usage of formal methods during the protocol design is very limited or missing at all. To address the problem of providing the designer with a user-friendly but rigorous design approach based on the use of formal methods, supporting security assurance already at the model level, but hiding the complexity of formal notations and verification techniques, in this paper we propose an approach, based on the Abstract State Machine formal method, for the specification and verification of security protocols. Specifically, we introduce a set of built-in primitives to model communication protocols and their security properties. Security verification can be carried out under the hypothesis of either a passive or an active attacker. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of its application to the Z-Wave protocol, claimed to be one of the most secure protocol for IoT devices communication thanks to the addition of the S2 Security class. We show the formal specification of the Z-Wave protocol and the security verification process. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Executable formal specifications allow the designer to attain early validation and verification of design using static analysis techniques and accurate simulation of the runtime behavior of the system-to-be. With increasing complexity of software-intensive computer-based systems and the challenges of validation and verification of abstract software models prior to coding, the need for interactive software tools supporting executable formal specifications is even more evident. In this paper, we discuss how CoreASM, an environment for writing and running executable specifications according to the ASM method, provides flexibility and manages the complexity by using an innovative extensible language architecture.

In this paper, we give a formal description of Synapse using the Abstract State Machines framework. The formal description pertains to Synapse actions that manipulate distributed keys. Based on this formal description, we present results concerning the expected exhaustiveness for a number of scenarios and systems maintained by the Synapse protocol, and provide comparisons to the results of the corresponding simulations and experiments. We show that the predicted theoretical results match the obtained experimental results, and give recommendations on the design of systems using Synapse.

J	Arcaini, P; Holom, RM; Riccobene, E				Arcaini, Paolo; Holom, Roxana-Maria; Riccobene, Elvinia			ASM-based formal design of an adaptivity component for a Cloud system	FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING			English	Article						Distributed systems; Cloud computing; Abstract State Machines; Modeling process; Model refinement; Validation; Verification	MODELS; VERIFICATION; LANGUAGE	The request of formal methods for the specification and analysis of distributed systems is nowadays increasing, especially when considering the development of Cloud systems and Web applications. This is due to the fact that modeling languages currently used in these areas have informal definitions and ambiguous semantics, and therefore their use may be unreliable. Thanks to their mathematical foundation, formal methods can guarantee rigorous system design, leading to precise models where requirements can be validated and properties can be assured, already at the early stages of the system development. In this paper, we present a rigorous engineering process for distributed systems, based on the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formal method. We rely on the foundational notions of ASM ground model and model refinement to obtain a precise model for a client-server application for Cloud systems. This application has been proposed to tackle the problem of making Cloud services usable to different end-devices by adapting on-the-fly the content coming from the Cloud to the different devices contexts. The ASM-based modeling process is supported by a number of validation and verification activities that have been exploited on the component under development to guarantee consistency, correctness, and reliability properties.

We focus on purely managed, fully portable threading features of C#. The sequential model interleaves the computation steps of the currently running threads and is suitable for uniprocessors. The parallel model addresses problems of true concurrency on multi-processor systems. The models provide a sound basis for the development of multi-threaded applications in C#. The thread and memory models complete the abstract operational semantics of C# in [Borger et al. Theoret. Comput. Sci., to appear]. The main invariants of the thread model concerning locks, monitors and mutual exclusion are formally verified in the AsmTP system, an interactive proof assistant based on ASM logic.

Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, network and communication failures, and misbehavior. The current paper proposes a decision-based solution for the dynamic adaptation part of a middleware which addresses the aforementioned problems for large-scale distributed systems. The envisioned architecture is built on case-based reasoning principles and stands at the base of the adaptation processes that are imperative for ensuring the delivery of high-quality software. The solution is further extended through ground models with a focus on reliability, availability of components, and failure tolerance in terms of abstract state machines. The novelty of the approach resides in making use of formal modeling for one of the emerging problems and introducing an adequate prototype, on top of which one can apply reasoning and verification methods.

Use Case Maps (UCM) is being standardized as part of the User Requirements Notation (URN), the most recent addition to ITU-T's family of languages. UCM models allow the description of functional requirements and high-level designs at early stages of the development process. Recognizing the importance of having a well defined semantic, we propose, in this paper, a concise and rigorous formal semantics for Use Case Maps (UCM). The proposed formal semantics addresses UCM's operational semantics and covers the key language functional constructs. These semantics are defined in terms of Multi-Agent Abstract State Machines that describes how UCM specifications are executed and eliminates ambiguities hidden in the informal language definition. The resulting operational semantics are embedded in an ASM-UCM simulation engine and are expressed in AsmL, an advanced ASM-based executable specification language. The proposed ASM-UCM engine provides an environment for executing and simulating UCM specifications. We illustrate our approach using an example of a simplified call connection.

This paper presents a novel approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the Abstract State Machine as runtime model representing the enforcement strategy aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. The enforcer software is designed as an autonomic manager that wraps around the software system to monitor and manage unsafe system changes using probing and effecting interfaces provided by the system, so realising grey-box safety enforcement. The proposed approach is supported by a component framework that is here illustrated by means of a case study in the health-care domain.

Specific artefacts are usually developed to complement specification with validation and verification activities. To avoid boresome and time-consuming activities when reusing models, in a model refinement specification process, techniques supporting reusability of formal development artefacts are highly desirable. In this paper, we tackle the problem of defining a technique for automatic refinement of abstract test cases for formal models given in terms of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We present an approach, based on a classical test generation technique exploiting model checking, able to reuse information of test cases obtained at a given level of abstraction in order to define, in an automatic way, the same kind of artefacts at a subsequent refinement level. We evaluate our approach on real case studies specified in ASMs by a sequence of refinement models.

J	Severyanov, VM				Severyanov, VM			Automata network dynamical systems for construction of fractal objects	MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION			English	Article						fractal geometry; iterated function systems; automata networks; evolving algebras		Fractal geometry plays an important role in the contemporary science. In some sense, objects with integer dimension are partial cases of the more general realm of entities having a ragged shape and fractional dimension. Fractals of a broad class are described by deterministic iterated function systems (IFSs). Simultaneously, the iterated function systems give a base for 'automata networks' capable to realize their latent dynamics. When such a dynamics become alive (with the help of an appropriate automata network), it finishes in a steady state which is (in the general case) a fractal set. In this report, an algorithm is described for building an automata network for a given iterated function system. It is worth noting that the automata networks' can be considered generalizations of cellular automata, the main difference is that our automata networks have non-regular structure of the system of the cell neighborhoods. An evolving algebra approach for description of the automata network dynamical systems is also mentioned. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of IMACS.

The complex and intricate nature of situation analysis processes calls for evolutionary modeling and formal engineering methods that facilitate experimental validation of abstract mathematical descriptions to link the essential design aspects with rapid prototyping in early development phases. For the transition from abstract concepts and requirements to precise specifications to high level design of situation analysis systems, we derive here a generic ASM ground model as a framework for defining the precise meaning of fundamental situation analysis concepts applicable to different application domain models.

The MSL-centric framework allows the definition of the structure of MAPE-K loops using the MAPE Specification Language (MSL), and the description of its adaptation logic in terms of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). These models can be tested by exploiting classical model-based testing for ASMs that allows structural coverage of ASM models, but which is not adequate to test executions that are peculiar of the structure of MAPE-K loops. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a MAPE-based testing approach, which generates, from the MSL model, test goals specifying requirements on the control loop executions, translates these into concrete test predicates for the corresponding self-adaptive ASM, and then generates (by using a model checking based technique) abstract tests covering these test predicates. Such abstract tests are suitable to test the desired executions of MAPE control loops. The application of the approach is demonstrated on a smart home case study.

Each object (iterator, container) belongs to a definite object type and possesses a state and a unique identifier represented by a typed address. Iterators axe divided in different iterator categories. Containers are collections of iterators of the corresponding category.

J	Hofman, W				Hofman, Wout			An Innovative Government Architecture with Semantic Technology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE			English	Article						Abstract State Machines; Data Custodian; Data Management; Data Policy; Data Stewardship; Ontology; Public Services		Over the past decade, authorities invested highly in public service provision over the Internet via portals. Back office systems of authorities collect and store data entered by citizens and enterprises to support decision-making by civilians. The data represents both the state of citizens and enterprises, public service transactions, and the physical infrastructure including ownership relations. Whilst civilians use the data for decisions, data quality influences decision quality. As data steward, civilians have improved data quality by removing duplicate data and created specific data stores for reference data like addresses, enterprises, and citizens. Citizens and enterprises can use reference data to complete electronic public service request forms. To further improve data quality, civilians perform physical inspections and/or assess external data sources to validate for instance data consistency. Besides data steward, civilians are also data custodian: they provide processing and storage facilities. In this contribution, the author will argue that an innovative architecture separating data steward and data custodian roles, currently held by civilians, decreases the Total Cost of Ownership of authorities' IT and contributes to economic growth. In the proposed approach, persons and organizations take the data stewardship role, facilitated by a provider of a data custodian role either in the public or private domain. Civilians can access the data for decision-making. Civilians still act as data steward with respect to additional data resources than provided by citizens and enterprises in decision-making. The approach is illustrated by a case and supported by the governance policy of for instance Dutch Customs Authority.

J	Bonfanti, S; Riccobene, E; Scandurra, P				Bonfanti, Silvia; Riccobene, Elvinia; Scandurra, Patrizia			A component framework for the runtime enforcement of safety properties	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Runtime safety enforcement; Self-adaptation; MAPE-K; Runtime models; Abstract State Machines@run; time		Safety assurance of a complex system cannot be completely ensured at design/development time since most uncertainties and unknowns are revealed when the system is deployed in a real environment. Safety assurance at runtime can be addressed by using models formalizing those safety assertions the system has to guarantee during operation, and specifying enforcement strategies aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. This paper presents an approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the State Machine as runtime model to specify safety assertions and enforcement strategies for steering the correct system behavior. The enforcer software is designed to act as a proxy system which wraps around the software system to realize safety enforcement, both as black-box enforcement on unsafe I/O events and as gray-box enforcement on unsafe internal system changes. The proposed approach is supported by a component framework called RSE (Runtime Safety Enforcement) that is here illustrated by means of two real case studies in the health-care domain.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

It consists in generating test sequences from ASM models and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. This process is applied at different models, starting from the more abstract model to the one that is very close to the code. The process consists of the following steps: (1) model the system as an Abstract State Machine, (2) generate test sequences based on the ASM model, (3) compute the code coverage using generated tests, (4) if the coverage is low refine the Abstract State Machine and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach to Antidote, an open-source implementation of IEEE 11073-20601 Personal Health Device (PHD) protocol which allows personal healthcare devices to exchange data with other devices such as small computers and smartphones.

Mutation testing is time-consuming and computationally expensive by nature. Therefore, automated tool support is indispensable for conducting mutation testing. Little research has been devoted to applying mutation testing to the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism. This paper presents MuAsmetaL, an AsmetaL-based experimental system for conducting automated mutation analysis. MuAsmetaL supports the generation of AsmetaL-based mutants (produced by applying a set of 44 mutation operators categorized into 4 classes), executes test cases against the produced mutants, and reports the analysis results. An empirical evaluation of MuAsmetaL has been conducted using a set of 6 publicly available AsmetaL specifications.

We aim to overcome two facts: 1) simulation is not identification, 2) the ASMs simulating machines of some type do not constitute a natural class among all ASMs. We modify Gurevich's notion of ASM to that of EMA ("Evolving MultiAlgebra") by replacing the program (which is a syntactic object) by a semantic object: a functional which has to be very simply definable over the static part of the ASM. We prove that very natural classes of EMAs correspond via "literal identifications" to slight extensions of the usual machine models and also to grammar models. Though we modify these models, we keep their computation approach: only some contingencies are modified. Thus, EMAs appear as the mathematical model unifying all kinds of sequential computation paradigms.

There has been a trend over the last decade towards implementations based on multiprocessor distributed concurrent systems with software components allocated to processors. Designing the system-wide operation, synchronisation and exception handling for such a complex system becomes impossible at the level of traditional process synchronisation primitives, as it becomes intellectually unmanageable to grasp the system-wide behaviour when tackled piecemeal and `bottom up'. An alternative top down approach to structuring and designing the overall behaviour of highly concurrent systems implemented using components is presented. It is based on using one or more simple abstract state machines to define the system-wide synchronisation required in terms of the desired system-level behaviour rather than in terms of the low-level synchronisation primitives chosen for the fine grain of the implementation solution. A practical example involving the creation of a high availability processing system made up of several commercial quality computers is used to illustrate the concept.

We show that any parallel algorithm satisfying intuitively-appealing postulates can be modelled by a collection of cells, each of which is an abstract state machine, augmented with the ability to spawn new cells. The cells all run the same algorithm and communicate via a shared global memory. Using a formal definition of what makes such an algorithm effective, we prove the validity of the Parallel Computation Thesis, according to which all reasonable parallel models of computation have roughly equivalent running times.

The importance and acceptance of SDL in the telecommunication industry surpasses that of UML, which can be seen as the major competitor. A crucial difference between SDL and UML is the existence of a formal SDL semantics as part of the international standard, which has a positive impact on the quality of the entire language definition. In this paper, we treat fundamental questions concerning practicability, adequacy and maintainability of the formalization approach, provide insights into the formal semantics definition and point out several effects on the SDL standard.

The development process starts from a high level formal view of the system and, through refinement, derives more detailed models till the desired level of specification. Along the process, different validation and verification activities are available, as simulation, model review, and model checking. Moreover, each refinement step can be proved correct using an SMT-based approach. As last step of the refinement process, a Java implementation can be developed and linked to the formal specification. The correctness of the implementation w.r.t. its formal specification can be proved by means of model-based testing and runtime verification. The process is exemplified by using a Landing Gear System as case study.

J	Hassine, J; Alkrarha, O				Hassine, Jameleddine; Alkrarha, Osama			A Mutation-Based Approach for Testing AsmetaL Specifications	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Mutation testing; Specification; Abstract state machines (ASM); AsmetaL; Mutation operator; Adequacy; Test suite; Testcoverage criteria	COVERAGE; MODELS	The detection of specification errors can help reduce the cost and risk of software development because uncorrected defects in specifications will propagate to code, thus adversely affecting the quality of the end product. Mutation testing is a well-established fault-based technique for assessing and improving the quality of test suites. Mutation testing can be applied at different levels of abstraction, e.g., the unit level, the integration level, and the specification level. In this paper, we propose a suite of AsmetaL-specific mutation operators, classified into four categories. The proposed operators are used to assess the adequacy of test suites generated using the ATGT tool, according to various test coverage criteria. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through eight publicly available AsmetaL case studies. The results of the case studies show that our proposed mutation operators can be used to compare different AsmetaL-based test coverage criteria and successfully detect inadequacies in test suites.

The lack of theoretical foundations in the field of Software Engineering has a counterpart, as the theoretical foundations have not caught up with the development of practical software systems. This raises the question how a theory of computation should look like that modernises the classical theory and at the same time is suitable for practical systems development. This article is dedicated to a sketch of a theory of computation centred around the notion of algorithmic systems. I will argue that behavioural theories are key to the understanding, i.e. we require language-independent axiomatic definitions of classes of algorithmic systems that are accompanied by abstract machine models provably capturing the class under consideration. The machine models give further rise to tailored logics through which properties of systems in the considered class can be formalised and verified, and to fine-tuned classifications on the grounds of complexity restrictions. All extensions are conservative in the sense that the classical theory of computation is preserved, universal in the sense that all practical developments are captured uniformly, and practical in the sense that languages associated with the abstract machine models can be used for rigorous high-level systems design and development, and the logics can be exploited for rigorous verification of desirable properties of systems.

Manual test writing or automated random test generation techniques are often used for such validation practices. However, directing tests to particular reachable states of a SystemC model is often difficult, especially when these models are large and complex. In this work, we present a model-driven methodology for generating directed tests that take the SystemC model under validation to specific reachable states. This allows the validation to uncover very specific scenarios which lead to different corner cases. Our formal modeling is done entirely within the Microsoft SpecExplorer tool to describe the specification of the system under validation in the notation of AsmL. We also exploit SpecExplorer's abilities for state space exploration for our test generations, and its APIs for connecting the model to implementation programs to drive the validation of SystemC models with the generated test cases.

The Abstract State Machine Theorem states that every classical algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to an abstract state machine. This theorem presupposes three natural postulates about algorithmic computation. Here. we show that augmenting those Postulates with an additional requirement regarding basic operations gives a natural axiomatization of computability and a proof of Church's Thesis, as Godel and others suggested may be possible. In a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations. one can prove Turing's Thesis, characterizing the effective string functions, and-in particular-the effectively-computable functions on string representations of numbers.

The flexibility in modeling reactive system behavior, the well defined underlying concurrency framework, and the ability to gradually sharpen requirements into specifications, inspires viewing the ASM paradigm as an agile formalization method that directly supports fundamental practical needs in modeling such systems.

The MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) autonomic control loop is the most influential reference control model for self-adaptive systems. The design of complex distributed self-adaptive systems having decentralized adaptation control by multiple interacting MAPE components is among the major challenges. In particular, formal methods for designing and assuring the functional correctness of the decentralized adaptation logic are highly demanded. This article presents a framework for formal modeling and analyzing self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a formalism, called self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, that exploits the concept of multiagent Abstract State Machines to specify distributed and decentralized adaptation control in terms of MAPE-K control loops, also possible instances of MAPE patterns. We support validation and verification techniques for discovering unexpected interfering MAPE-K loops, and for assuring correctness of MAPE components interaction when performing adaptation.

In reality, of course, there are no miracles. A message goes from one network to another; it can be lost or corrupted in the process. Here, we present a realistic but high-level communication model where abstract communicators represent various nets and subnets. The model was originally developed in the process of specifying a particular network architecture, namely, the Universal Plug and Play architecture. But, it is general. Our contention is that every message-based distributed system, properly abstracted, gives rise to a specialization of our abstract communication model. The purpose of the abstract communication model is not to design a new kind of network; rather, it is to discover the common part of all message-based communication networks. The generality of the model has been confirmed by its successful reuse for very different distributed architectures. The model is based on distributed abstract state machines. It is implemented in the specification language AsmL and is used for testing distributed systems.

J	Hassine, J				Hassine, Jameleddine			Early modeling and validation of timed system requirements using Timed Use Case Maps	REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Requirements; Non-functional; Time modeling; Timed Use Case Maps (TUCM); User Requirements Notation (URN); Abstract State Machines (ASM)	SOFTWARE; SEMANTICS; SUPPORT	There is a general consensus on the importance of good requirements engineering for achieving high-quality software. Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while nonfunctional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language. We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis. We illustrate the applicability of our approach using a business process model (conference review process model) and a real-time system model (IP multicast routing case study).

J	Blass, A; Gurevich, Y				Blass, Andreas; Gurevich, Yuri			Persistent Queries in the Behavioral Theory of Algorithms	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC			English	Article						Algorithms; Languages; Theory; Verification; Abstract state machines; interactive algorithms; sequential algorithms; small-step algorithms; step-for-step simulation		We propose an extension of the behavioral theory of interactive sequential algorithms to deal with the following situation. A query is issued during a certain step, but the step ends before any reply is received. Later, a reply arrives, and later yet the algorithm makes use of this reply. By a persistent query, we mean a query for which a late reply might be used. Our proposal involves issuing, along with a persistent query, a location where a late reply is to be stored. After presenting our proposal in general terms, we discuss the modifications that it requires in the existing axiomatics of interactive sequential algorithms and in the existing syntax and semantics of abstract state machines. To make that discussion self-contained, we include a summary of this material before the modifications. Fortunately, only rather minor modifications are needed.

J	Gargantini, A; Riccobene, E; Scandurra, P				Gargantini, Angelo; Riccobene, Elvinia; Scandurra, Patrizia			A semantic framework for metamodel-based languages	AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Metamodelling; Model-based development; Model driven engineering; Formal methods; Abstract state machines; Language semantics; Semantic (meta-)hooking; Weaving behaviour		In the model-based development context, metamodel-based languages are increasingly being defined and adopted either for general purposes or for specific domains of interest. However, meta-languages such as the MOF (Meta Object Facility)-combined with the OCL (Object Constraint Language) for expressing constraints-used to specify metamodels focus on structural and static semantics but have no built-in support for specifying behavioral semantics. This paper introduces a formal semantic framework for the definition of the semantics of metamodel-based languages. Using metamodelling principles, we propose several techniques, some based on the translational approach while others based on the weaving approach, all showing how the Abstract State Machine formal method can be integrated with current metamodel engineering environments to endow language metamodels with precise and executable semantics. We exemplify the use of our semantic framework by applying the proposed techniques to the OMG metamodelling framework for the behaviour specification of the Finite State Machines provided in terms of a metamodel.

Our focus is on network enabled operations to efficiently manage and improve employment of a set of mobile resources, their information fusion engines and networking capabilities under dynamically changing and essentially unpredictable conditions. A high-level model of the proposed architecture is formally described in abstract functional and operational terms based on the Abstract State Machine formalism.

We used this definition as the basis of the formal veri. cation of the refinements of the Mondex case study with the interactive theorem prover KIV. The refinement definition we give differs from the one we gave in earlier work which preserves partial and total correctness assertions of ASM runs. The reason is that the main goal of the refinement of the Mondex protocol is to preserve a security invariant, while total correctness is not preserved. To preserve invariants, the definition of generalized forward simulation is limited to the use of "small" diagrams, which contain of a single protocol step. We show a technique that allows to use the natural "big" diagrams that consist of an atomic action being refined by a full protocol run.

This raised the need for formal modelling of these systems to address reliability and robustness requirements. This paper addresses the problem of developing a formal semantics, based on abstract state machines (ASM), for modelling of distributed control systems for industrial CPS based on the IEC 61499 standard. The developed approach allows to build formal models of flexible distributed control systems for analysis and verification of various properties.

J	Drozdov, D; Dubinin, V; Patil, S; Vyatkin, V				Drozdov, Dmitrii; Dubinin, Victor; Patil, Sandeep; Vyatkin, Valeriy			A Formal Model of IEC 61499-Based Industrial Automation Architecture Supporting Time-Aware Computations	IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY			English	Article						Computational modeling; IEC Standards; Mathematical model; Automation; Semantics; Data models; Computer architecture; Abstract state machines; CPS; formal semantics; formal verification; IEC 61499; time-aware computations	VERIFICATION; SYSTEMS	This paper proposes a formal model for industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS) with distributed control based on IEC 61499 standard and supporting time-aware computations for better adaptation to the ever changing environment conditions. Main features of the model include usage of timestamps, flattening, unified and independent behaviour of function block interfaces. This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language. The paper discusses the time-aware computation concept and its application in a few related case studies.
