  abstract               = {Smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum are increasingly used to automate complex transactions in a secure and transparent manner. However, ensuring their correctness and resistance to attacks remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a formal approach for modeling and assessing the security of Ethereum smart contracts using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). ASMs provide a rigorous framework for precisely describing smart contract behavior, including interactions with potentially malicious contracts. By modeling attackers as contracts designed to exploit known vulnerabilities, our method enables the systematic evaluation of a contract’s robustness in adversarial scenarios, thereby providing a quantifiable assessment of its security. We demonstrate this approach on a Solidity smart contract, assessing its resilience against three well-known vulnerabilities to illustrate the effectiveness of our security analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

The theory comprises a set of postulates defining the class of RAs, an abstract machine model, and the proof that all RAs are captured by this machine model. RAs are sequential-time, parallel algorithms, where every state includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using multiset comprehension terms as values. The abstract machine model is defined by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs), which extend ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

  abstract               = {Smart contracts are programs that automate agreements between parties without the need for intermediaries. Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant financial losses. This paper introduces a method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The approach models a smart contract as an Abstract State Machine (ASM), where the absence of specific vulnerabilities is encoded as invariants. An existing symbolic execution technique for ASM models was extended and improved to enable the processing of the ASM models of the smart contracts. By symbolically executing the ASM, the method identifies faulty execution paths that violate these invariants, exposing potential vulnerabilities in the contract’s behavior. Vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart contract can be generated using the symbolic execution results. As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running case study, the Auction smart contract. Furthermore, we discuss the results of applying the technique to a number of Solidity smart contracts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

The restrictions can be incorporated into the semantics of ASM rules such that update sets are only yielded, if the conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, the conditions can be checked in polynomial time on a simulating Turing machine. Finally, the conditions imply global insignificance, i.e. the final result is independent from the choices. These properties suffice to show that the ASMs restricted this way define a logic capturing PTIME, which we call insignificant choice polynomial time (ICPT). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

  abstract               = {To face complexity and scalability, the design of software-intensive systems requires the decomposition of the system into components, each modeled and analyzed separately from the others, and the composition of their analysis. Moreover, compositional model simulation is recognized as the only alternative available in practice when systems are large and complex, like in the cyber-physical domain, and intrinsically require combining the specification of ensembles of different parts (subsystems). Therefore, the need for simulation engines for composed model execution is getting a growing interest. Along this research line, this paper presents the results of the compositional modeling and validation by scenarios of an industrial medical system, called MVM-Adapt, that we designed as an adaptive version of an existing mechanical lung ventilator deployed and certified to treat pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit the I/O Abstract State Machine formalism to model the device components as separate and interacting sub-systems that communicate through I/O events and adapt the device ventilation mode at run-time based on the health parameters of the patient. An orchestrated simulation coordinates the overall execution of these communicating I/O ASMs by exploiting suitable workflow patterns. This compositional simulation technique has proved to be useful in practice to validate the new adaptive MVM's behavior and thus to support architects in better understanding this new mode of operation of the prototyped system. © 2025 The Author(s)},

  abstract               = {Modeling complex system requirements often requires specifying system components in separate models, which can be validated and verified in isolation from each other, and then integrating all components' behavior in order to validate the operation of the whole system. If models are executable, as for state-based formal specifications, engines to orchestrate the simulation of separate component operational models are extremely useful. This paper presents an approach for the co-simulation, according to predefined orchestration schemas, of state-based models of separate components of a Discrete Event System. More precisely, we exploit the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method as state-based formalism, and we (i) define a set of operators to compose ASMs that communicate with each other through I/O events, and (ii) present an engine to execute the compositional simulation of the ASMs as a whole assembly. As proof of concepts, we use a set of model examples of Discrete Event Systems of increasing complexity to show the application of our approach and to evaluate its effectiveness in co-simulating models of real systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

  abstract               = {Ensuring software functionality, maintainability, and modularity is vital while developing UIs. For this reason, architectural patterns, like the Model–View–Controller (MVC), are usually employed. The MVC aims to separate the representation of information (model) from its presentation to the user (view). One can use a formal model to study the system and the UI, but such formal models are separately developed and analyzed, and the results of the analysis cannot be assured for the actual implementation. To address this problem, we introduced the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), allowing the integration of Asmeta specifications into the model of the MVC-designed software. This paper extends the fMVC pattern and the framework to better support Java Swing components and enhance error management, including automatic model state rollback on input failure. Moreover, we propose an extension enabling testers to generate and reuse Avalla scenarios for UI validation. We demonstrate the framework’s application, covering modeling, validation, and verification at the model level for the AMAN case study that inspired us during the definition of the fMVC pattern. Moreover, we show how the AMAN UI can be implemented and tested by our approach. © The Author(s) 2025.},

We adopted a seamless system engineering method: from an incremental formal specification of high-level requirements to increasingly refined ASMETA models, to the C++ code generation from the model. Along this process, different validation and verification activities were performed. We explored modeling styles and idioms to face the modeling complexity and ensure that the ASMETA models can best capture and reflect specific behavioral patterns. Through this realistic automotive case study, we evaluated the applicability and usability of our formal modeling approach. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Smart contracts are programs or protocols embedded into the distributed ledgers and are used to automate agreements between parties of a blockchain. Smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks due to their immutable and public nature, thus, it is important to guarantee the correctness of contracts already at design-time in order to avoid catastrophic events and huge loss of money.In this paper, we investigate the usage of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method for the specification, validation and verification of Ethereum smart contracts. We present the ASM model of the Ethereum virtual machine, and we define a set of ASM libraries that simplify smart contracts modeling. We also provide models of malicious contracts in terms of ASM libraries that can be used to check if a given smart contract is vulnerable to a certain attack. As a proof of concept, we show our approach by exploiting the DAO smart contract and its vulnerability to a reentrancy attack. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Manually converting formal models into code poses challenges such as increased costs, limitations in specification reuse, and the potential for introducing errors. To overcome these limitations, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches enable developers to generate software code automatically. This paper proposes the Asmeta2Java tool for the automatic translation of formal Asmeta specifications into executable Java code. The designers start at an abstract level and perform refinement steps and verification activities. At the end, they automatically generates the code by applying the model-to-code transformation. Moreover, a process to validate and evaluate the transformation is presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Following this idea, in this paper, we propose an approach for incrementally verifying the dynamic semantics specified with abstract state machines (ASMs), such that definitions of previous versions must not be altered in subsequent versions. As a result, the compiler can be verified incrementally without revising the proofs of previous versions. As our first step, in this paper, we formalize and verify the memory mapping of the initial versions with ASMs and discuss their extensibility for the next increments. We plan to demonstrate this approach through the agile implementation and verification of a Sather-K compiler generating MIPS assembly language. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

  abstract               = {Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are widely used in the formalization and verification of the semantics of software or hardware. However, tools for assisting this process for evolving specifications are still lacking. With evolving we denote adding extensions without refactoring. We want to create a tool assisting in the verification of evolving specifications. Our approach is to translate ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, construct the proofs as far as possible automatically, and check the proofs with the proof checker. Further, we want proofs of evolvable specifications also to be evolvable. This paper gives a brief overview of the approach and discusses the first step of this work, namely the translation of ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, with consideration of automation possibilities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Smart contracts often handle valuable assets and execute critical functions, making them attractive targets for attackers. Thus, secure and reliable smart contracts are necessary. The long-term research we present aims to face the problem of safety and security assurance of smart contracts at design time. We are investigating the usage of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method for the specification, validation, and verification of Ethereum smart contracts. We provide (i) a set of ASM libraries that simplify smart contracts modeling, (ii) models of malicious contracts to be used to check the robustness of a contract against some given attacks, (iii) patterns of properties to be checked to guarantee the operational correctness of the contract and its adherence to certain predefined properties. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

This framework uses the Blackboard system for communication between Scout, Attack, and Analysis Agents. The combined efforts of these agents are aimed at assessing the security available on the networks, and a Decision-Making Agent (DMA) controls it all by making crucial decisions using collected information. This leads to a much better scalability and sophistication of security analyses, thus enhancing the penetration testing process. To guarantee the reliability and robustness of our framework, we use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) as a method to develop a formal model expressing this framework. The model developed is then validated and verified against some defined constraints and properties in order to demonstrate safety, free-deadlock, liveness, and reachability of the elaborated framework. © 2024 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {The provision of resources to meet workloads demands has become a crucial responsibility for auto-scaling mechanisms (auto-scalers) on cloud infrastructures. However, implementing auto-scaling mechanisms on cloud frameworks has presented numerous technical challenges. A typical challenge is that, these auto-scalers are often designed on different cloud systems making their evaluation, comparisons and wider applicability problematic. To address this issue, we propose an Abstract State Machine (ASM) model as a solution. Our ASM model was developed systematically according to the behaviours of several auto-scalers, covering the necessary system processes. Rigorous validation and evaluation of our model have been conducted using the CoreASM Model Checker. The results demonstrate that our model can effectively analyze and generate accurate ASM refinements for auto-scalers, even without the need for real-life experiments. Our model, therefore, provides the platform to evaluate the behaviours of algorithms executed on clouds. © 2023 Slovene Society Informatika. All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {IoT (Internet of Things) devices are extensively used in security-critical services, as for example home door opening, gas monitoring, alarm systems, etc. Often, they use communication protocols with no standardisation and no security guarantee. Unsecured use of connected devices can cause threats or damages to the users, so security assurance, which can be ensured by the use of formal methods, must be guaranteed. Unfortunately practical usage of formal methods during the protocol design is very limited or missing at all. To address the problem of providing the designer with a user-friendly but rigorous design approach based on the use of formal methods, supporting security assurance already at the model level, but hiding the complexity of formal notations and verification techniques, in this paper we propose an approach, based on the Abstract State Machine formal method, for the specification and verification of security protocols. Specifically, we introduce a set of built-in primitives to model communication protocols and their security properties. Security verification can be carried out under the hypothesis of either a passive or an active attacker. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of its application to the Z-Wave protocol, claimed to be one of the most secure protocol for IoT devices communication thanks to the addition of the S2 Security class. We show the formal specification of the Z-Wave protocol and the security verification process. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract               = {Safety assurance of a complex system cannot be completely ensured at design/development time since most uncertainties and unknowns are revealed when the system is deployed in a real environment. Safety assurance at runtime can be addressed by using models formalizing those safety assertions the system has to guarantee during operation, and specifying enforcement strategies aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. This paper presents an approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the State Machine as runtime model to specify safety assertions and enforcement strategies for steering the correct system behavior. The enforcer software is designed to act as a proxy system which wraps around the software system to realize safety enforcement, both as black-box enforcement on unsafe I/O events and as gray-box enforcement on unsafe internal system changes. The proposed approach is supported by a component framework called RSE (Runtime Safety Enforcement) that is here illustrated by means of two real case studies in the health-care domain. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The RATE approach consists in generating test sequences from ASMs and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. The process follows these steps: (1) model the system as an abstract state machine; (2) validate and verify the model; (3) generate test sequences automatically from the ASM model; (4) execute the tests over the implementation and compute the code coverage; (5) if the coverage is below the desired threshold, then refine the abstract state machine model to add the uncovered functionalities and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach in three case studies: a traffic light control system (TLCS), the IEEE 11073-20601 personal health device (PHD) protocol, and the mechanical ventilator Milano (MVM). By applying RATE, at each refinement level, we have increased code coverage and identified some faults or conformance errors for all the case studies. The fault detection capability of RATE has also been confirmed by mutation analysis, in which we have highlighted that, many mutants can be killed even by the most abstract models. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The processing operation is to perform the thinning in the singular regions of the track pattern handwritten character after determining the thinning in the regular regions. In fact, it is considered a character of the Latin alphabet, the letter "R"in capital letters, or the digit "4", chosen because they contain all the singularities that are possible to find the other characters or figures, and applies them to a technique structural decomposition intended for training and recognition using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Of course, the same character written by different authors, or by the same author at different times, produces a different result. So, the training activities are more properly configured with an operation for classifying handwritten characters more or less similar, based on slight differences in slope of the stroke. The strokes are the parts of the track, the character components manuscript. The classification of characters allows obtaining a knowledge base to be used in the recognition phase. © 2023 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Using architectural patterns is of paramount importance for guaranteeing the correct functionality, maintainability and modularity, especially for complex software systems. The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern is typically used in user interfaces (UIs), since it allows the separation between the internal representation of the information and the way it is shown to users. The main problem of using this approach in a formal setting, where formal models are used to specify the requirements and prove safety properties, is that those models are not directly used within the MVC pattern and, thus, all the activities performed at model-level are somehow lost when implementing the UI. For this reason, in this paper, we present the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), an extension of the classical MVC where the model is a formal specification, written using Abstract State Machines. This pattern is supported by the AsmetaFMVCLib, which allows the user to link the formal model with the view and the controller by using simple Java annotations. We present the application of fMVC on a simple example of a calculator for explanatory purposes, then we apply it to the AMAN case study, which has inspired the definition of fMVC. We discuss the advantages of fMVC and its shortcomings, trying to identify the scenarios where it should be applied and possible alternatives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The theory comprises a set of language-independent postulates defining the class of RSAs, an abstract machine model, and the proof that all RSAs are captured by this machine model. RSAs are sequential-time, bounded parallel algorithms, where the bound depends on the algorithm only and not on the input. Every state of an RSA includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using terms as values. The model of reflective sequential abstract state machines (rsASMs) extends sequential ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a tree algebra. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In line with such a vision, this paper describes our experience in modeling the behavior of the MVM-Adapt, an adaptive version of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that has been designed, certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic for treating pneumonia. To keep the complexity of the requirements and models under control, we exploited a compositional modeling technique for discrete-event systems based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Essentially, separate ASMs represent the behavior of interacting subsystems of the MVM with their new adaptive functionalities; they can communicate with each other through I/O events, and co-operate by a precise orchestration schema. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {We develop a behavioural theory of reflective sequential algorithms (RSAs), i.e. sequential algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. The theory comprises a set of language-independent postulates defining the class of RSAs, an abstract machine model, and the proof that all RSAs are captured by this machine model. As in Gurevich's behavioural theory for sequential algorithms RSAs are sequential-time, bounded parallel algorithms, where the bound depends on the algorithm only and not on the input. Different from the class of sequential algorithms every state of an RSA includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using terms as values. The model of reflective sequential abstract state machines (rsASMs) extends sequential ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract            = {This paper deals with consultation as a role of consultant like a teacher in a virtual reality class for lessons. The consultation subject is taken in causal analysis and database design to conceive causal relation. The causal analysis is abstracted into effectiveness which is caused by requisites and prohibitions for effects. The database design is represented as recursive Backus-Naur Form for structural expressions. Then abstract consultation can be regarded as a function to transform effectiveness into recursive representation. The sense or meaning of such abstract consultation may be a semantics of conditioned formulas in modal logic. The modal logic is formulated in this paper, by extending postfix modality for name of database design as well as greatest fixed point operator for denoting an equilibrium state set where the transformation of effectiveness with prefix modality to design with postfix modality may be available. The conditioning of formulas is given by a state set so that the formula may be considered in terms of propositional base. As regards recursive representations in Backus-Naur Form for database design, model theory is established in 3-valued domain, for the sense of strong negation in accordance to prohibitions influencing effectiveness. Some fixed point is taken for the mapping associated with recursive representations, where the mapping is related to formations of models over 3-valued domain. The fixed point model can be seen as means of retrieval. However, because the mapping is generally a nonmonotonic function whose fixed point semantics is not always available, we have another method to adopt negation as failure for strong negation such that the model of a given recursive representation as database is always guaranteed if the representation takes a restricted form. Abstract consultation to effectiveness for database design is thus formulated, with model theory in database representations. © © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

  abstract               = {Model-based simulation is nowadays an accepted practice for reliable prototyping of system behavior. To keep requirements complexity under control, system components are specified by separate models, validated and verified in isolation from the rest, but models have to be subsequently integrated and validated as a whole. For this reason, engines for orchestrated simulation of separate models are extremely useful. In this paper, we present a compositional simulation technique for managing the co-execution of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) communicating through I/O events. The proposed method allows the co-simulation of ASM models of separate subsystems of a Discrete Event System in a straight-through processing manner according to a predefined orchestration schema. We also present our experience in applying and validating the proposed technique in the context of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano) system, a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract            = {While there exist many consistency models for distributed systems, most of those models seek to provide the basic guarantee of convergence: given enough time and no further inputs, all replicas in the system should eventually converge to the same state. However, because of Convergence Failure Bugs (CFBs), many distributed systems do not provide even this basic guarantee. The violation of the convergence property can be crucial to safety-critical applications collectively working together with a shared distributed system. Indeed, many CFBs are reported as major issues by developers. Our key insight is that CFBs are caused by divergence, or differences between the state of replicas, and that a focused exploration of divergence states can reveal bugs in the convergence logic of real distributed systems while avoiding state explosion. Based on this insight, we have designed and implemented Modulo, the first Model-Based Testing tool using Divergence Resync Models (DRMs) to systematically explore divergence and convergence in real distributed systems. Modulo uses DRMs to explore an abstract state machine of the system and derive schedules, the intermediate representation of test cases, which are then translated into test inputs and injected into systems under test (SUTs). We ran Modulo to check ZooKeeper, MongoDB, and Redis and found 11 bugs (including 6 previously unknown ones). © 2022 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, ATC 2022.All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {There are hardly two fields in Computer Science that are further apart than Software Engineering and Theoretical Computer Science. The lack of theoretical foundations in the field of Software Engineering has a counterpart, as the theoretical foundations have not caught up with the development of practical software systems. This raises the question how a theory of computation should look like that modernises the classical theory and at the same time is suitable for practical systems development. This article is dedicated to a sketch of a theory of computation centred around the notion of algorithmic systems. I will argue that behavioural theories are key to the understanding, i.e. we require language-independent axiomatic definitions of classes of algorithmic systems that are accompanied by abstract machine models provably capturing the class under consideration. The machine models give further rise to tailored logics through which properties of systems in the considered class can be formalised and verified, and to fine-tuned classifications on the grounds of complexity restrictions. All extensions are conservative in the sense that the classical theory of computation is preserved, universal in the sense that all practical developments are captured uniformly, and practical in the sense that languages associated with the abstract machine models can be used for rigorous high-level systems design and development, and the logics can be exploited for rigorous verification of desirable properties of systems. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract            = {Rigorous development processes aim to be effective in developing critical systems, especially if failures can have catastrophic consequences for humans and the environment. Such processes generally rely on formal methods, which can guarantee, thanks to their mathematical foundation, model preciseness, and properties assurance. However, they are rarely adopted in practice. In this paper, we report our experience in using the Abstract State Machine formal method and the ASMETA framework in developing a prototype of the control software of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to time constraints and lack of skills, no formal method was applied for the MVM project. However, we here want to assess the feasibility of developing (part of) the ventilator by using a formal method-based approach. Our development process starts from a high-level formal specification of the system to describe the MVM main operation modes. Then, through a sequence of refined models, all the other requirements are captured, up to a level in which a C++ implementation of a prototype of the MVM controller is automatically generated from the model, and tested. Along the process, at each refinement level, different model validation and verification activities are performed, and each refined model is proved to be a correct refinement of the previous level. By means of the MVM case study, we evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our formal approach. © A. Bombarda, S. Bonfanti, A. Gargantini & E. Riccobene.},

  abstract               = {Reflective algorithms are algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this article the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs, by means of which we can formally express properties a reflective algorithm must satisfy. The proof theory associated with the logic then enables static verification of adaptive systems. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

As in other state-based formal methods, the proposed modeling languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend abstractions to structure state and behavior aspects of specifications. Modern object-oriented languages offer a variety of advanced language constructs, and most of them either offer interfaces, mixins, or traits in addition to classes and inheritance. Our goal is to investigate these language constructs in the context of state-based formal methods using ASMs as a representative of this kind of formal methods. We report on a controlled experiment with 105 participants to study the understandability of the three language constructs in the context of ASMs. Our hypotheses are influenced by the debate of object-oriented communities. We hypothesized that the understandability (measured by correctness and duration variables) shows significantly better understanding for interfaces and traits compared to mixins, as well as at least a similar or better understanding for traits compared to interfaces. The results indicate that understandability of interfaces and traits show a similar good understanding, whereas mixins shows a poorer understanding. We found a significant difference for the correctness of understanding comparing interfaces with mixins. © 2021 The Author(s)},

The study was carried out with a completely randomized design and one alternative (interface or trait) per experimental group. The results indicate that specification effectiveness of the traits experiment group shows a better performance compared to the interfaces experiment group, but specification efficiency shows no statistically significant differences.

Main features of the model include usage of timestamps, flattening, unified and independent behaviour of function block interfaces. This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language.

  abstract               = {The use of models and formal analysis techniques at runtime is fundamental to address safety assurance during the system operational stage, when all relevant uncertainties and unknowns can be resolved. This paper presents a novel approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the Abstract State Machine as runtime model representing the enforcement strategy aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. The enforcer software is designed as an autonomic manager that wraps around the software system to monitor and manage unsafe system changes using probing and effecting interfaces provided by the system, so realising grey-box safety enforcement. The proposed approach is supported by a component framework that is here illustrated by means of a case study in the health-care domain. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract            = {Nowadays, IoT (Internet of Things) devices are becoming part of our daily life. Unfortunately, many of them do not use standardized communication protocols with a provable security guarantee. The use of formal methods is, therefore, highly demanded in order to perform property verification and to prevent possible threats and accidents to users. In this paper, we propose a formal verification of the Z-Wave protocol, claimed to be one of the most secure IoT communication protocols thanks to the new S2 Security class, recently added. Specifically, our analysis targets the joining procedure of a device to the Z-Wave net. We exploit the ASMETA formal framework to model the protocol and to perform formal analysis in terms of model validation against informal documented requirements and verification of the protocol correct behaviour with respect to its security goals. The verification process revealed a vulnerability that could be used to perform a successful Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack compromising the secrecy of the exchanged symmetric keys. © © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

  abstract               = {MapReduce supports the processing of large data sets in parallel. It has been shown that MapReduce is an example for the use of the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) bridging model, a model for parallel computation on a fixed set of processors comprising alternating computation and communication phases. In this article we extend the normal execution of MapReduce from processing large finite data sets to processing stream queries with input data stream assumed to continue indefinitely. We classify stream queries into three classes, memoryless, semi-memoryless and memorable, and provide the model for each class using MapReduce based on BSP. In addition, as some stream queries require large amounts of computing sources, the BSP computation model is extended to a model with unbounded many agents, but preserving the barrier synchronization. A behavioral theory is developed for this model extending the behavioral theory of the BSP model. This comprises an axiomatization, the definition of Infinite-Agent BSP abstract state machines (Inf-Ag-BSP-ASM) and the proof that such ASMs capture the unbounded synchronized computations. Finally, we show how MapReduce processing can be further improved on grounds of the unbounded extension. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are a well-known state based formal method to describe systems at a very high level and can be executed either through a concrete or symbolic interpretation. By symbolically executing an ASM specification, certain properties can be checked by transforming the described ASM into a suitable input for model checkers or Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). Due to the rather fast increasing state space, model checking and ATP solutions can lead to inefficient implementations of symbolic execution. More efficient state space and execution performance can be achieved by using a concolic execution approach. In this paper, we describe an improved concolic execution implementation for the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language. We outline the transformation of a symbolically executed ASM specification to a single Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) format. Furthermore, we introduce a compiler analysis to promote concrete ASM functions into symbolic ones in order to obtain symbolic consistency. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {In the security protocols domain, formal verification is more and more highly demanded to guarantee security assurance: humans increasingly depend on the use of connected devices in their daily life, so they must be protected against possible threats and accidents. However, formal verification, and in general the use of formal methods, is slowed by myths and misconceptions, mainly due to their mathematical base, which discourages many designers or engineers from their adoption. In this paper, we pose the basis for the long-term development of an ASM-based user-friendly framework for the formal verification of security protocols. We introduce a mathematical-based set of templates to formalise common patterns in security protocols and a set of security properties. These templates facilitate the protocol formal verification by providing built-in functions and domains, as well as transition rules and property schema, to be customised according to the specific protocol to be verified. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of their application to a number of well-known cryptographic security protocols. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {The domain of Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) is somewhat outstanding due to its embracing of Subject Orientation. However, at the same time, it is also a classic BPM domain concerned with typical aspects like creation and exchange of diagrammatic process models, elicitation of domain knowledge, and implementing process (models) into organisations and IT systems. Nevertheless, the Abstract State Machine (ASM) concept, a formal and abstract specification means for algorithms, has been and is fundamental and an important cornerstone for the S-BPM community. The first formal specifications for S-BPM has been developed by Egon Börger using ASM means—namely a specification for an interpreter engine for the subject-oriented modeling language PASS, the Parallel Activity Specification Schema. However, for the sake of intuitive and comprehensive use, ASM can be enriched with defining the passive aspects of PASS, namely the (data) structure of process models and data object appearing in the processes. Here it is useful to complement ASM description means with concepts that are better suited for that tasks. This work analyzes how the S-BPM research community has combined ASM with the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to generate a precise, while comprehensible, system specification for the execution of formal, subject-oriented process models. Furthermore, it will be argued why this combination is worthwhile overcoming the weaknesses of both generic and technology independent specification approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this paper, we discuss the notion of the natural abstraction level of an algorithm and how ASM manage to capture this abstraction level. We will look into three areas of algorithms: the algorithm execution, the algorithm description, and the algorithm semantics. We conclude that ASM capture the natural abstraction level of the algorithm execution, but not necessarily of the algorithm description. ASM do also capture the natural abstraction level of execution semantics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The use of models and formal analysis techniques is highly demanded both at design-time, to guarantee safety and other desired qualities already at the early stages of the system development, and at runtime, to address requirements assurance during the system operational stage. In this paper, we present the modeling features and analysis techniques supported by ASMETA (ASM mETAmodeling), a set of tools for the Abstract State Machines formal method. We show how the modeling and analysis approaches in ASMETA can be used during the design, development, and operation phases of the assurance process for safety-critical systems, and we illustrate the advantages of integrated use of tools as that provided by ASMETA. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {In view of the increasing importance of cyber-physical systems, and of their correct design, the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework is extended to include continuously varying quantities as well as the conventional discretely changing ones. This opens the door to the more faithful modelling of many scenarios where digital systems have to interact with the continuously varying physical world. Transitions in the extended framework are thus either moded (catering for discontinuously changing quantities), or pliant (catering for smoothly changing quantities). An operational semantics is provided, first for monolithic systems, and this is then extended to give a semantics for systems consisting of several distinct subsystems. This allows each subsystem to undergo its own subsystem-specific mode and pliant transitions. Refinement is elaborated in the extended context for both monolithic and composed systems.

It can not effectively determine the size and position of the graphic display, and it is difficult to effectively support the graphic language layout control. Therefore, this paper proposes a new automatic graphic language arrangement algorithm in visual communication design. Through the fixed value method to calculate the display size of buffer image in visual communication design, the minimum number of layout layout and the maximum surface utilization are taken as the layout objective function; the ant colony algorithm is used to solve the problem, and the optimal solution is obtained to obtain the best display position of the graphics in visual communication design. The description of graphic language is realized by syntax description based on rules and semantic description based on ASM (abstract state machine). This paper describes the parallel process and selection process of graphic language in visual communication design by using parallel and selection logo, and realizes automatic layout of graphic language by using parallel process and selection process. The algorithm is programmed and run by C language officer to achieve the purpose of automatic arrangement of graphic language. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The MSL-centric framework allows the definition of the structure of MAPE-K loops using the MAPE Specification Language (MSL), and the description of its adaptation logic in terms of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). These models can be tested by exploiting classical model-based testing for ASMs that allows structural coverage of ASM models, but which is not adequate to test executions that are peculiar of the structure of MAPE-K loops. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a MAPE-based testing approach, which generates, from the MSL model, test goals specifying requirements on the control loop executions, translates these into concrete test predicates for the corresponding self-adaptive ASM, and then generates (by using a model checking based technique) abstract tests covering these test predicates. Such abstract tests are suitable to test the desired executions of MAPE control loops. The application of the approach is demonstrated on a smart home case study. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {We are interested in specifications which provide a consistent high-level view of systems. They should abstract irrelevant details and provide a precise and complete description of the behaviour of the system. This view of software specification can naturally be expressed by means of Gurevich's Abstract State Machines (ASMs). There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi-)automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We devise a method consisting in two phases. In the first phase we propose fully automated transformations from source code to base-level ASM specifications with the same core functionality. We present a prototype of an implementation of this phase which transforms Java code into base-level ASM specifications. The second phase consists in incrementally applying sound semi-automated abstraction procedures for ASMs to derive higher-level specifications, starting from the base-level ASM specification obtained in the first phase. This is by no means a trivial task. It opens up new and interesting research questions. We discuss possible methodologies to approach this task and provide a proof of concept in the form of elaborated and detailed examples. We argue that this process can be done in a (semi-)automated way and thus result in a valuable tool to improve the current software engineering practices. © 2020},

  abstract               = {In architecture-based self-adaptation of decentralized systems, design patterns have been introduced to ease the design of complex adaptation solutions that usually require the interaction of different MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) control loops, each dealing with an adaptation concern of the managed system. Such MAPE patterns have been proposed by means of a graphical notation, but without a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of components interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome these limitations. We present a domain-specific language, called MSL for MAPE Specification Language, to define and instantiate MAPE patterns and to give semantics to some semantic variation points of the equivalent graphical notation for MAPE pattern. We also provide a formal semantics of the language by means of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, an extension of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formalism to model self-adaptation. Such semantics definition comes with an automatic transformation of MSL models into formal executable models, and opens to the possibility of performing rigorous analysis (validation w.r.t. the adaptation requirements and verification of adaptation properties) of MSL models. Moreover, we present our current results toward a (long-term) realization of an MSL-centric framework, where MSL is the notation of a modeling front-end, on top of richer and more specific modeling, analysis, and implementation back-end frameworks. As proof of concept of our approach, we show the application of MSL and its formal support to a running case study in the field of home automation, by modeling an adaptive control of a virtual smart home developed with the OpenHAB runtime platform. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract               = {According to best practices of model-driven engineering, the implementation of a system should be obtained from its model through a systematic model-to-code transformation. We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. The process has been used to validate our model-to-code transformations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract            = {Rehabilitation of patients during illnesses associated with the loss of motor skills, such as multiple sclerosis, is an important task of medicine. Effective in these cases are gaming approaches that increase patient motivation, which in the field of e-Health form the direction of "Serious Games". The essential requirements in the development of Serious Games are the continuity of training, which should be carried out not only in a specialized center, but al-so by the patient himself at home, as well as the accuracy of the movements performed by the patient; otherwise, the outcome of the rehabilitation will be doubtful or even negative. As the basis for satisfying the rigorous requirements for the correctness of the movements performed the automatic simulation of the game process is chosen. Serious Games differ from regular games in a significantly smaller number of possible states, which makes them convenient for applying this approach. At the same time, in contrast to the previously considered applications of au-tomaton models in medical systems, such as, for example, systems for sup-porting hemodialysis, in the case of a game, the parameters of each state can vary over a fairly wide range. In the article, this problem is considered in the example of rehabilitation of pinch movements of hands by performing physical exercises in a specialized video game form using motion capture of fingers on a smartphone. The Ab-stract State Machine method is used to build the automaton model applicable to the Serious Game for pinch movement, which provides opportunities and motivation of the patient to do independent exercises. To build the resulting model, the method of successive refinements is used, on each of which veri-fication is performed, which provides the necessary control over the accuracy of patient movements. © Proceedings of the 12th IADIS International Conference e-Health 2020, EH 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

  abstract            = {'What is an algorithm?' is a fundamental question of computer science. Gurevich's behavioural theory of sequential algorithms (aka the sequential ASM thesis) gives a partial answer by defining (non-deterministic) sequential algorithms axiomatically, without referring to a particular machine model or programming language, and showing that they are captured by (nondeterministic) sequential Abstract State Machines (nd-seq ASMs). However, recursive algorithms such as mergesort are not covered by this theory, as has been pointed out by Moschovakis, who had independently developed a different framework to mathematically characterize the concept of (in particular recursive) algorithm. In this article we propose an axiomatic definition of the notion of sequential recursive algorithm which extends Gurevich's axioms for sequential algorithms by a Recursion Postulate and allows us to prove that sequential recursive algorithms are captured by recursive Abstract State Machines, an extension of nd-seq ASMs by a CALL rule. Applying this recursive ASM thesis yields a characterization of sequential recursive algorithms as finitely composed concurrent algorithms all of whose concurrent runs are partial-order runs. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

So, many real usage scenarios might be impossible to reproduce and validate at design-time. As envisioned by the Models@run.time research community, the use of models at runtime is fundamental to address this challenge. Our focus is on providing guarantees for changing safety goals at runtime (a form of uncertainty) with the employment of mathematically-based runtime analysis techniques from the area of formal methods (FM@run.time). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the runtime simulation of Abstract State Machine models and the on-the-fly changes of safety assertions at the model level to provide software assurance guarantees at runtime. The framework is called AsmetaS@run.time and is being developed as part of the ASM specification and analysis toolset ASMETA. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

The behaviors of the described expressions may be captured (with their models) as causing sequences for state transitions, where composition and alternation for state transitions are mechanized in algebraic structure. Monitoring facilities to the language system may be described with state concepts, as well. With respect to intuitionistic logic and logical program containing negatives, Heyting algebra expressions are taken rather than already established nonmonotonic reasoning programs with negations, where 3-valued domain may be of use for the undefined to be allowable such that positives and negatives may be consistently evaluated, instead of rigid 2-valued settlements. We may have a standard form of Heyting algebra expressions in accordance to logical and AI programming, where the expressions are constrained with states. The states may be regarded as environmental conditions or objects as in object-oriented programming. As regards 3-valued models of given expressions, monotonic mapping cannot be in general associated with, but some ways are presented to approximate fixed points of a mapping for the given expression. Then the formal description of programs may be given with reference to state transitions, which is thought of as proposing a language system structure. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

On one hand, this is due to the intrinsic complexity of the methods and, therefore, some level of required expertise is unavoidable. On the other hand, however, the methods are sometimes hard to use because of lack of a user-friendly tool support. In this paper, we present our experience in addressing usability when developing a framework for the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formal method. In particular, we discuss how we enhanced modeling, validation, and verification activities of an ASM-based development process. We also provide a critical review of which of our efforts have been more successful as well as those that have not obtained the results we were expecting. Finally, we outline other directions that we believe could further lower the adoption barrier of the method. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

  abstract               = {Reflective algorithms are algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this paper the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs to capture inferences on rASMs. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

  abstract               = {In the context of automotive domain, modern control systems are software-intensive and have adaptive features to provide safety and comfort. These software-based features demand software engineering approaches and formal methods that are able to guarantee correct operation, since malfunctions may cause harm/damage. Adaptive Exterior Light and the Speed Control Systems are examples of software-intensive systems that equip modern cars. We have used the Abstract State Machines to model the behaviour of both control systems. Each model has been developed through model refinement, following the incremental way in which functional requirements are given. We used the ASMETA tool-set to support the simulation of the abstract models, their validation against the informal requirements, and the verification of behavioural properties. In this paper, we discuss our modelling, validation and verification strategies, and the results (in terms of features addressed and not) of our activities. In particular, we provide insights on how we addressed the adaptive features (the adaptive high beam headlights and the adaptive cruise control) by explicitly modelling their software control loops according to the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) reference control model for self-adaptive systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

The question we answer in this paper, is how to add concurrency based on locks to such a refinement tower, without breaking the initial modular structure. We achieve this by just enhancing the relevant components, and adding intermediate atomicity refinements that complement the data refinements that are already there. We also give a verification methodology for such atomicity refinements. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

  abstract               = {Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known state-based formal method to analyze, verify, and specify software and hardware systems. Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications. Almost all built-in behaviors are implicitly defined inside a concrete ASM language implementation and thus, the behavior is hidden from the language user. In this paper, we present a new ASM syntax extension based on traits, which allows the specifier (language user) to define new type abstractions in the form of structure and behavior definitions to reuse, maintain, structure, and extend the functionality in ASM specifications. We describe the proposed language construct by defining its syntax and semantics. The decision to use a trait-based syntax extension over other object-oriented language constructs like interfaces or mixins was motivated and driven by the results of previously conducted empirical studies. Moreover, we outline details about the implementation of the trait-based syntax extension in our Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language implementation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

However, we remained intrigued by the fact that Blass and Gurevich used partial-order runs of distributed ASMs to explain runs of sequential recursive algorithms. We discovered that also the inverse simulation holds: for every distributed ASM with partial order runs, these runs can be described by runs of a sequential recursive algorithm. This surprising result clarifies the difference in expressivity between partial-order and concurrent runs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

  abstract               = {During YuriFest 2010 the discovery of a proof search algorithm devised in the 1020s by Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) was announced. A Gurevich abstract state machine was given in evidence that Ibn Sīnā really did intend an algorithm; this was needed because Ibn Sīnā explained the algorithm by a long sequence of exercises, not by a rigorous definition. More recently a radically original logical decision algorithm has come to light in the work of the 12th century Baghdad scholar Abū al-Barakāt. Taking these algorithms alongside the already known algorithms of al-Khwārizmī for solving quadratic equations, and of al-Khalīl for listing finite sequences of letters, we can see that the medieval Arabic scholars uncovered a range of algorithms of various kinds. But it seems that they never brought these algorithms together under a single notion of ‘algorithm’; in fact we know of no writer who drew a comparison between any two of these algorithms. A natural question for historical research is to uncover what kinds of entity the medieval Arabic scholars thought these algorithms were. The present paper assembles some raw material that should be relevant to this question, including a not very successful attempt by al-Fārābī to institute a theory of logical procedures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

  abstract               = {Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP ) is a bridging model for HPC (High Performance Computing) algorithm design. It provides a conceptual bridge between the physical implementation of the machine and the abstraction available to a programmer, while having portable and scalable performance predictions of BSP algorithms on most HPC systems. Two questions may come to mind. What are formally BSP algorithms? And how to ensure that the programmer can effectively program every BSP algorithm with a BSP language, especially with the right cost? Gurevich proved that three convincing postulates for the sequential algorithms are equivalent to what is called Abstract State Machines (ASMs ), and thus that ASMs capture the sequential algorithms. Firstly, we extend these sequential postulates and ASMs in order to intuitively and realistically capture the BSP algorithms (and not more). Secondly, by using an operational semantics and an algorithmic simulation, we prove that [Formula presented] is equivalent to [Formula presented], a minimal imperative BSP programming language. Therefore, BSP programming languages (extending at least [Formula presented]) are BSP algorithmically complete, involving the definition of a class model of the BSP algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract               = {Computations with real numbers are decisive for all scientific and technical applications, in particular cyber-physical systems, and precision in the results is essential for quality and safety. The type-2 theory of effectivity (TTE) is a well established theory of computability on infinite strings, which can be used to represent real numbers by rapidly converging Cauchy sequences, on top of which standard operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc. can be defined. In this paper we develop an extension of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) handling streams in an incremental way in accordance with TTE. This enables defining a data type Real as part of the background structure and based on this exact computation with real numbers. Output can be generated at any degree of precision by exploring only sufficiently long prefixes of the representing Cauchy sequences. We then outline an ASM development process that starts from a specification of an algorithm using Real, proceeds by making the rational elements of the Cauchy sequences explicit in a refinement, reconsiders this refined specification as a concurrent ASM, where each agent cares about computation up to some precision, and finally, based on a detailed analysis of the required precision, prunes the concurrent ASM down to an ASM that guarantees a sufficient level of precision in the outputs. In doing so, backward precision propagation replaces the common forward error propagation that is common for implementations exploiting floating point arithmetic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In a computation phase the programs proceed independently and asynchronously until a barrier is reached. In a communication phase initiated by all programs having reached the barrier only messages between the programs are exchanged until normal processing can be continued. In this article we present a behavioural theory for BSP computations comprising an axiomatisation of the BSP model, the definition of a restricted class of concurrent abstract state machines, which we call BSP abstract state machines, and the proof that BSP abstract state machines capture BSP computations as defined by the axiomatisation. We illustrate the use of BSP abstract state machines on map-reduce. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods and techniques supporting rigorous formal design of system architecture where software components interact with each other and control physical components are highly demanded to assure reliability of the system operation. We present a formal model of the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3, the new standard of the European Rail Traffic Management System, aiming to replace the different national train control and command systems by a unique European railway management system. We use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method to provide a complete specification of the standard. The model has been developed through a sequence of model refinement steps following the incremental way in which requirements describe train operation. We have exploited the ASMETA tool-set supporting the ASMs to simulate the abstract models and validate them with respect to the operational scenarios that are given as part of the requirements. We discuss ambiguities and inconsistencies of the requirements, as well as difficulties encountered in the specification and during scenarios simulation. © 2019 ACM.},

Eye-tracking experiments were performed in two different countries using a Pupil Labs eye-tracking headset. An example specification and simple comprehension tasks were used as stimuli. The preliminary results of the eye-gaze behaviour analysis reveal that the new language feature was undestood well, but the new abstractions were frequently confused by participants. The foreknowledge of specific programming concepts is crucial how these abstractions are comprehended. More research is needed to infer this knowledge from viewing patterns. © 2019 IEEE.},

Specific artefacts are usually developed to complement specification with validation and verification activities. To avoid boresome and time-consuming activities when reusing models, in a model refinement specification process, techniques supporting reusability of formal development artefacts are highly desirable. In this paper, we tackle the problem of defining a technique for automatic refinement of abstract test cases for formal models given in terms of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We present an approach, based on a classical test generation technique exploiting model checking, able to reuse information of test cases obtained at a given level of abstraction in order to define, in an automatic way, the same kind of artefacts at a subsequent refinement level. We evaluate our approach on real case studies specified in ASMs by a sequence of refinement models. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {We present a paradigm and implementation of a parallel control flow model for algorithmic patterns of two nested loops; an outer iteration loop and an inner data traversal loop. It is centered around memory access patterns. Other than dataflow programming it emphasizes on upholding the sequential modification order of each data object. As a consequence the visible side effects on any object can be guaranteed to be identical to a sequential execution. Thus the set of optimizations that are performed are compatible with C's abstract state machine and compilers could perform them, in principle, automatically and unobserved. We present two separate implementations of this model. The first in C++ uses overloading of the operator[] to instrument the memory accesses. The second in Modular C uses annotations and code transformations for the two nested loops. Thereby the code inside the loops may stay as close as possible to the original code such that optimization of that code is not impacted unnecessarily. These implementations show promising results for appropriate benchmarks from polybench and rodinia. © 2019 IEEE.},

A scenario of a potential attack specifies the flow but not the content of messages. Using scenarios can reduce the number of protocol runs to be explored during attack searching via simulation. The number of runs can be further reduced by minimizing the number of intruder’s generated messages. The intruder’s ability to generate messages is limited by considering: the expected message content and type matching. Our approach uses two tools that support the Abstract State Machines method: the AsmetaL for modelling purposes and the AsmetaS for performing the simulation. We propose a simple model for the specification of commutative encryption. Several protocols are examined to show the effectiveness of our method. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

We formalise this problem by the notion of the greatest consistent specialisation (GCS) adapting and generalising this 20 year old concept to sequential Abstract State Machines (ASMs) with emphasis on bounded parallelism. In a state satisfying I such that P is repairable the notion of consistent specialisation will require an enlargement of the update set, which defines a partial order with respect to which a GCS is defined. We show that GCSs are compositional in two respects: (1) the GCS of an ASM with a complex rule can be obtained from the GCSs of the involved assignments, and (2) the GCS with respect to a set of invariants can be built using the GCSs for the individual invariants in the set. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

They should abstract irrelevant details and provide a precise and complete description of the behaviour of the system. This view of software specification can naturally be expressed by means of Gurevich’s Abstract State Machines (ASMs). There are many known benefits of such an approach to system specifications for software engineering and testing. In practice however, such specifications are rarely generated and/or maintained during software development. Addressing this problem, we present an exploratory study on (semi) automated extraction of high-level software specifications by means of ASMs. We describe, in the form of examples, an abstraction process which starts by extracting an initial ground-level ASM specification from Java source code (with the same core functionality), and ends in a high-level ASM specification at the desired level of abstraction. We argue that this process can be done in a (semi) automated way, resulting in a valuable tool to improve the current software engineering practices. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

It even permits a strict separation between memory managing agents and other agents that can only access the shared memory by sending query and update requests. This paper is dedicated to an investigation of replicated data that is maintained by a memory management subsystem, where the replication neither appears in the requests nor in the corresponding answers. We specify the behaviour of a concurrent system with such memory management using concurrent communicating ASMs (ccASMs), provide several refinements addressing different replication policies and internal messaging between data centres, and analyse their effects on the runs with respect to consistency. We show that on a concrete level even a weak form of consistency is only possible, if view serialisability can be guaranteed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {In this paper we propose a new approach to conformance testing based on Abstract State Machine (ASM) model refinement. It consists in generating test sequences from ASM models and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. This process is applied at different models, starting from the more abstract model to the one that is very close to the code. The process consists of the following steps: (1) model the system as an Abstract State Machine, (2) generate test sequences based on the ASM model, (3) compute the code coverage using generated tests, (4) if the coverage is low refine the Abstract State Machine and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach to Antidote, an open-source implementation of IEEE 11073-20601 Personal Health Device (PHD) protocol which allows personal healthcare devices to exchange data with other devices such as small computers and smartphones. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

  abstract               = {The development of medical devices is a safety-critical process, because a failure or a malfunction of the device can cause serious injuries to the patients whom use it. The application of a rigorous process for their development reduces the risk of failures since validation and verification activities can be performed in a objective, reproducible, and documentable manner. In this paper we present an approach based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method. Starting from the model, validation and verification (V&V) techniques can be applied. Furthermore, by step-wise refinement, a final model can be obtained, which can be automatically translated to code. The process is applied to the smart pill box case study. Starting from the ASM model, we generate code for the Arduino platform after the application of V&V activities. Furthermore, we introduce regulation (IEC62304) and guidelines (FDA General Principles of Software Validation) that support the developer in medical software development. In particular, we explain how ASMs formal process can be compliant with them. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {Distribution of computation is well-known, and there are several frameworks, including some formal frameworks, that capture distributed computation. As yet, however, models of distributed computation are based on the idea that data is conceptually centralized. That is, they assume that data, even if it is distributed, is consistent. This assumption is not valid for many of the database systems in use today, where consistency is compromised to ensure availability and partition tolerance. Starting with an informal definition of eventual consistency, this paper explores several measures of inconsistency that quantify how far from consistency a system is. These measures capture key aspects of eventual consistency in terms of distributed abstract state machines. The definitions move from the traditional binary definition of consistency to more quantitative definitions, where the classical consistency is given by the highest possible level of consistency. Expressing eventual consistency in terms of abstract state machines allows models to be developed that capture distributed computation and highly available distributed data within a single framework. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {According to the Church-Turing Thesis, effectively calculable functions are functions computable by a Turing machine. Models that compute these functions are called Turing-complete. For example, we know that common imperative languages (such as C, Ada or Python) are Turing complete (up to unbounded memory). Algorithmic completeness is a stronger notion than Turing-completeness. It focuses not only on the input-output behavior of the computation but more importantly on the step-by-step behavior. Moreover, the issue is not limited to partial recursive functions, it applies to any set of functions. A model could compute all the desired functions, but some algorithms (ways to compute these functions) could be missing (see [10, 27] for examples related to primitive recursive algorithms). This paper's purpose is to prove that common imperative languages are not only Turing-complete but also algorithmically complete, by using the axiomatic definition of the Gurevich's Thesis and a fair bisimulation between the Abstract State Machines of Gurevich (defined in [16]) and a version of Jones' While programs. No special knowledge is assumed, because all relevant material will be explained from scratch. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

The behavioural theory of DAS provides an axiomatic definition plus a proof that concurrent reflective abstract state machines (crASMs) captures all systems stipulated by the axioms.

ETF (Eiffel Testing Framework) is a tool for generating code from an abstract grammar specification of user interface actions derived from the requirements document. Mathmodels extends the classical Eiffel contracting notation with the use of mathematical models (based on sets, sequences, relations, functions, bags). The Mathmodels library has immutable queries (for specifications) as well as relatively efficient mutable commands (for describing executable abstract state machines). Models are developed and validated using the industrial strength Eiffel IDE, and the use of these tools thus scale up to the development of large systems in a way that supports the derivation of specification models from requirements, and seamlessness between models and code. © 2018 IEEE.},

We do this without sacrificing the completeness of the logic for statements about single steps of non-deterministic and parallel ASMs, such as invariants of rules, consistency conditions for rules, or step-by-step equivalence of rules. Moreover, we show that the proposed one-step logic can be easily extended to a multiple-step logic which enables reasoning about concurrent ASMs. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

This will increase the satisfaction of customers due to providing their QoS requirements. The available solutions to this problem often seek to improve one of the criteria for service quality and use different methods to achieve this goal. This paper is aimed at offering an optimal solution to solve the task scheduling problem in the cloud environment using the firefly algorithm. The proposed algorithm helps not only to reduce the longest task completion time, but also to increase the utilization of virtual machines by taking into account the capabilities of each virtual machine and using the appropriate method for distributing virtual machine requests. Although, finding a proper task scheduling method is desirable, the correctness of this approach that can be checked by the automatic formal verification methods is a challenge. One of the most efficient method in this area is model checking which can verify the behavior of a system by checking some desired properties on the system model. Hence, we define a behavioral model of the task scheduling algorithm based on model checking techniques. To do so, we encode the algorithm to Abstract State Machine Metamodel-based Language (AsmetaL) and then some properties are defined for verifying the algorithm. The results obtained from the implementation of the proposed method show that the proposed method has an acceptable improvement for makespan and resource utilization. © 2018 IEEE.},

There are still many functional or semantic problems for traditional modeling language and modeling method, when they are used into the security modeling. Therefore, based on the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL), this paper proposes the AADL error model and extracted the timing fault tree. After comprehensive analysis by using the common factor failure analysis and the hardware and software failure analysis, we can obtain the generation mechanism of danger. By establishing the AADL multi-view security model of the software system, and converting it into the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) and the Markov model, this paper forms a method of the security verification and evaluation based on extended AADL model. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing security analysis for an instance. © 2018 IEEE.},

One important obstacle to achieving this goal is that executing rules may result in a clash, that aborts the ASM run. This paper contributes three results towards this goal. First, it shows that it is possible to compute a first-order formula for each rule that implies clash-freedom when provable. The derived formula is not a precise characterization, but is provable for many ASMs that are used in practice. Second, we give axioms that describe the transition relation for clash-free ASM rules as formulas of predicate logic that can be used to verify pre/post-condition assertions using automated theorem provers. Third, we show that the relational encoding can be used to justify a calculus for clash-free ASM rules based on symbolic execution. Such a calculus is useful for interactive theorem provers such as our tool KIV. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper discusses how to integrate the use of a formal approach into the current normative for the medical software development. The rigorous process is based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method, its refinement principle, and model analysis approaches the method supports. The hemodialysis machine case study is used to show how the ASM-based design process covers most of the engineering activities required by the related standards, and provides rigorous approaches for medical software validation and verification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

First, it provides an overview of the main issues one must consider in modeling systems for verification. These issues involve both the selection or design of a modeling language and the steps of model creation. Next, it introduces a simple modeling language, SML, for illustrating the issues involved in selecting or designing a modeling language. SML uses an abstract state machine formalism that captures key features of widely-used languages based on transition system representations. We introduce the simple modeling language to simplify the connection between languages used by practitioners (such as Verilog, Simulink, or C) and various underlying formalisms (e.g., automata or Kripke structures) used in model checking. Third, the chapter demonstrates key steps in model creation using SML with illustrative examples. Finally, the presented modeling language SML is mapped to standard formalisms such as Kripke structures. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018. All rights reserved.},

  abstract            = {This book uses a variety of applications to illustrate a modeling method that helps practitioners to manage complex software-intensive systems. The proposed method relies on the combination of its abstraction concept and its operational character, with behavioral models in the precise and simple form of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The book introduces both the modeling method (Part I) and the available tool support (Part II): In Part I the authors detail (using numerous examples) how to construct, explain, debug, explore, extend and reuse accurate system design models, starting from scratch. Only an elementary knowledge of common mathematical (including set-theoretic) notation and some basic experience with computational processes (systems, programs, algorithms) is assumed. Part II then shows how the modeling method can be supported by implementing tools that make design models executable and debuggable. To illustrate how to build, debug and maintain systems and to explain their construction in a checkable manner, a general, problem-oriented refinement method is adopted to construct system models from components. The method starts with abstract models and refines them step by step, incrementally adding further details that eventually lead to code. Intended for practitioners who build software intensive systems, and students specializing in software engineering, it can be used both for self-study and for teaching, and it can serve as a reference book. Exercises are included to help readers check their understanding of the explained concepts. For many models defined in the book, refinements to executable versions can be downloaded for experimental validation from the book's website at http://modelingbook.informatik.uni-ulm.de. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018.

However, unlike other well-known formalisms, e.g. Petri nets, ASMs lack inherent, domain-independent characterisations of computationally important properties. Here, we provide an ASM-based characterisation of the starvation-free property. The classic, informal notion of starvation, usually provided in literature, is analysed and expressed as a necessary condition in terms of ASMs. Thus, we enrich the ASM framework with the notion of vulnerable rule as a practical tool for analysing starvation issues in an operational fashion. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The main objective of the BIOMICS project was to map the spontaneous order-construction ability of cellular biochemistry to computer science in the form of a new model of computation that we call Interaction Computing. The project did not achieve this objective, but it lay the groundwork for developing a mathematical theory of IC, it developed a computational framework that can support IC based on an extension of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) (Börger and Stärk, 2003) to Abstract State Interaction Machines (ASIMs), and reached a number of intermediate objectives. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

In case of large, complex and decentralized systems, multiple interacting MAPE loops are introduced. Some common design patterns of interactive MAPE components have been proposed in the literature; however, a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of their interactions is still missing. This paper presents a domain-specific language, MAPE Specification Language (MSL), as modeling front-end to define and instantiate common patterns of interacting MAPE components when architecting the adaptation logic of a self-adaptive system. We also provide a semantic mapping (implemented by a model generator) to transform MSL descriptions of MAPE pattern instances into formal executable models based on the formalism of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Such a mapping provides a link to the modeling back-end of ASMs for formally specifying and analyzing the behavior of instances of MAPE patterns. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

  abstract               = {Distributed computation is formalized in several description languages for computation, as e.g. Unified Modeling Language (UML), Specification and Description Language (SDL), and Concurrent Abstract State Machines (CASM). All these languages focus on the distribution of computation, which is somewhat the same as concurrent computation. In addition, there is also the aspect of distribution of state, which is often neglected. Distribution of state is most commonly represented by communication between active agents. This paper argues that it is desirable to abstract from the communication and to consider abstract distributed state. This includes semantic handling of conflict resolution, e.g. in connection with data replication. The need for abstract distribution of state is discussed and a novel semantics for concurrency based on an abstract distributed state is presented. This semantics uses runs over so-called multistates, and hides the internal communication for replica handling. This way, distributed computation is described over an abstract memory model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

  abstract               = {The automatic transformation of models to code is one of the most important cornerstones in the model-driven engineering paradigm. Starting from system models, users are able to automatically generate machine code in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Asm2C++ [4] is the tool that transforms Abstract State Machine models to code. However, no validation activities have been performed in the past to guarantee the correctness of the transformation process. In this paper, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. Coverage measures give a user the confidence that the generated code has the same behavior as specified by the ASM model. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.},

In this paper the evaluation of queries in the query language SPARQL on RDF data with meta-data is investigated. We first show that if the data are stratified, i.e. a particular partial order can be defined on the meta-data labels, then a nesting procedure can be applied, which induces a rewriting of the query. Based on a specification by an Abstract State Machine we show that the result of the rewritten query equals the one that would have resulted from the evaluation of the original query. We further investigate the reduction of complexity by using data and query nesting. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Such systems are hybrid, as some components are characterised by continuous behaviour, whereas the behaviour of others is discrete. SysML provides graphical notations capturing requirements for systems engineering. Here we present a concise conceptual model for systems engineering that is capable to capture the gist of SysML. The structural part is based on the common higher-order Entity Relationship model that is extended by continuous functions and various flow constraints. The behavioural part is then formalised by a hybrid extension of Abstract State Machines. The usage of the conceptual model is illustrated by a working example concerning the landing gear equipment of a plane. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for enabling application protocols to support authentication, integrity and confidentiality services. The SASL was originally specified in RFC 2222, and later updated in RFC 4422, using natural language. However, due to the richness of natural language this involves ambiguities and imprecision. Whilst there is an Oracle implementation of SASL, its documentation also contains informal descriptions and under-defined specifications of the RFCs. This paper provides clarification of ambiguity in SASL using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This clarification is based on two ASM essential notions: a ground model to capture the intended SASL behavior in an understandable way, and a refinement notion to accurately explicate the ambiguous parts of the behavior. We also show some differences between RFCs and the description of the Oracle implementation. We believe our work can serve as a basis for further implementation and for formal analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

  abstract               = {The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known formal method, which can be used to specify arbitrary algorithms, applications or even whole systems. Over the past years, there have been many approaches to implement concrete ASM-based modeling and specification languages. All of those approaches define their type systems and operator semantics differently in their internal representation, which leads to undesired or unexpected behavior during the modeling, the execution, and code generation of such ASM specifications. In this paper, we present CASM-IR, an Intermediate Representation (IR), designed to aid ASM-based language engineering which is based on a well-formed ASM-based specification format. Moreover, CASM-IR is conceptualized from the ground up to ease the formalization of ASM-based analysis and transformation passes. The feasibility of CASM-IR solving the uniform ASM representation problem is depicted. Based on our CASM-IR implementation, we were able to integrate a front-end of our statically inferred Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

  abstract               = {A distributed system can be characterised by autonomously acting agents, where each agent executes its own program, uses shared resources and communicates with the others, but otherwise is totally oblivious to the behaviour of the other agents. In a distributed adaptive system agents may change their programs, and enter or leave the collection at any time thereby changing the behaviour of the overall system. This article first develops a language-independent axiomatic definition of distributed adaptive systems and then presents concurrent reflective Abstract State Machines (crASMs), an abstract machine model for their specification. It can be proven that any distributed adaptive system as stipulated by the axiomatisation can be step-by-step simulated by a crASM. Proofs about crASMs can be grounded in a multiple-step logic, which extends known complete one-step logics for deterministic and non-deterministic ASMs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

In this paper an extension of Abstract State Machines by such expressions is introduced and its usefulness is demonstrated by examples of computations on graphs, such as graph factoring and checking self-similarity. In a naïve way these high-level specifications can be refined using submachines for the evaluation of the higher-order expressions. We show that refinements can be obtained in an automatic way for well-defined fragments of higher-order logic that collapse to second-order, by means of which the naïve refinement is only necessary for second-order logic expressions. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

In this paper, we propose a refinement of the NACK-based Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (N-AODV) protocol, namely Blackhole-free N-AODV (BN-AODV), as a solution to intercept (cooperative) blackhole attacks in MANETs. Thanks to a formalization through an Abstract State Machine-based model, the correctness of the proposed protocol is formally proved. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

  abstract               = {Large-Scale Distributed Systems are characterized by high complexity and heterogeneity, which might lead to unexpected failures. The role of a robust monitoring framework is to gather low-level data and assess the status of the components of the system. The framework collaborates with adapters for ensuring steady recovery plans and improving the availability of services. Monitors, as part of the system, are also affected by unavailability or random failures. In order to increase the reliability of the solution we verify the trustworthiness of the monitors and emphasize the need of redundancy. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying a monitoring solution for Large-Scale Distributed Systems. We formalize the behavior of the monitors with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model. The tool also supports the verification process by translating a simplified version of the model to an NuSMV specification, on top of which model checking can be applied. Properties of the model are expressed with the aid of computation tree logic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

  abstract               = {We identify significant weaknesses in the original Abstract State Machine (ASM) based choreography algorithm of Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO), which make it impractical for use in semantic web service choreography engines. We present an improved algorithm which rectifies the weaknesses of the original algorithm, as well as a practical, fully functional choreography engine implementation in Flora-2 based on the improved algorithm. Our improvements to the choreography algorithm include (i) the linking of the initial state of the ASM to the precondition of the goal, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a final state in the execution of the ASM and its linking to the postcondition of the goal, and (iii) modification to the execution of the ASM so that it stops when the final state condition is satisfied by the current configuration of the machine. Our choreography engine takes as input semantic web service specifications written in the Flora-2 dialect of F-logic. Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of ASMs (evolving algebras) and evolving ontologies in the sense that one can simulate the other, a first in literature. Finally, we present a visual editor which facilitates the design and deployment of our F-logic based web service and goal specifications. © 2018 Shahin Mehdipour Ataee and Zeki Bayram.},

The theory comprises a set of language-independent postulates characterising the class of RSAs, an abstract machine model that provably satisfies the postulates, and a proof that all RSAs are captured by this machine model. As in Gurevich’s thesis for sequential algorithms RSAs are sequential-time, bounded parallel algorithms, where the bound depends on the algorithm only and not on the input. Different from the class of sequential algorithms every state of an RSA includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. The model of reflective Abstract State Machines (rASMs) extends sequential ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

Faulty monitors might report nonexistent problems or neglect existing ones. Their correctness highly influences the reliability of the whole system. By formal modeling the monitoring processes, this paper aims to improve the robustness of the system and to capture fundamental properties of monitors.

  abstract            = {The development of complex and highly safety-critical avionics systems, such as fly-by-wire, is typicaUy linked with high efforts, risks and thus costs. Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation. Furthermore this includes the automatic generation of the associated traceability data and test specification documentation. An initial framework has been defined to support exchangeabiUty of individual tasks in the generation toolchain. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by testing the complete heterogeneous signal communication of an exemplary avionics system, resp. platform instance, at system level as well as at software high-level. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {In database theory, the term database transformation was used to refer to a unifying treatment for computable queries and updates. Recently, it was shown that non-deterministic database transformations can be captured exactly by a variant of ASMs, the so-called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs). In this article we present a logic for DB-ASMs, extending the logic of Nanchen and Stärk for ASMs. In particular, we develop a rigorous proof system for the logic for DB-ASMs, which is proven to be sound and complete. The most difficult challenge to be handled by the extension is a proper formalization capturing non-determinism of database transformations and all its related features such as consistency, update sets or multisets associated with DB-ASM rules. As the database part of a state of database transformations is a finite structure and DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers only over the database part of a state, we resolve this problem by taking update sets explicitly into the logic, i.e. by using an additional modal operator [X ], where X is interpreted as an update set Δ generated by a DB-ASM rule. The DB-ASM logic provides a powerful verification tool to study properties of database transformations. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

  abstract            = {The ever growing demands of software solutions have led to the development of Large-Scale Distributed Systems, which bring together a wide pool of services and resources. Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users' requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service and costs. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, failures and misbehavior. The role of the monitoring and adaptation components is essential in understanding failures of the system and reconfiguring it to a stable state based on the available information. We propose in this paper a distributed monitoring and adaptation solution responsible for identifying failures of the components and building recovery plans. The focus of the paper is to capture the nonfunctional and functional properties of the monitoring and adaptation layers in a formal model. We employ the rigorous Abstract State Machine method to build the control state diagram and define the ground model. We follow a formal approach using ASMETA toolset for defining the correct behavior of the components. © 2017 IEEE.},

The space and structure created by such technological advancements is an immense source of information and imposes a high complexity and heterogeneity, which might lead to unexpected failures. We propose in this paper a formal approach for capturing the behaviour of the monitoring and adaptation processes. We employ the Abstract State Machine rigorous method to elaborate the model and we further make use of the ASMeta framework to simulate and validate the specifications. Desired properties of the system are discussed and defined with the aid of the Computation Tree Logic. © 2017 IEEE.},

In order to provide the necessary confidence level, with regard to the respect of functional and non-functional properties, a system analysis that accounts for all possible execution paths must be performed. Symbolic execution has been successfully used to explore and analyze reachable system states. In this paper, we formally define a symbolic execution semantics for an abstract state machine based model. The unification of the update semantics redefined in terms of symbolic moves, enable us to achieve reacher methods for path condition resolution and ultimately better scalability of the execution. The goal of this paper is to provide a formal ground for the integration of symbolic execution in existing timing analysis frameworks based on abstract state machines that will facilitate the computability of the analysis tools. © 2017},

We show that under our operational semantics, DES models correspond to a certain form of abstract state machines (ASMs) such that the Future Event List (FEL) is part of the transition system state and the transition function is based on event routines. Unlike other formalisms proposed for DES (such as Petri Nets or DEVS), our ASM semantics takes all basic DES concepts (like event types and the FEL) into consideration and allows for expressive transition system states representing the objects, properties, relations and functions of the evolving possible worlds of a simulation run. As a direct formal semantics of DES, it provides a basis for comparing, and explaining design choices in, different DES approaches. © 2017 IEEE.},

Along the process, different validation and verification activities are available, as simulation, model review, and model checking. Moreover, each refinement step can be proved correct using an SMT-based approach. As last step of the refinement process, a Java implementation can be developed and linked to the formal specification. The correctness of the implementation w.r.t. its formal specification can be proved by means of model-based testing and runtime verification. The process is exemplified by using a Landing Gear System as case study. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a semi-formal hazard analysis method that aims to identify safety requirements emerging from the analysis of potential interactions among components and inadequate control in the system’s design. In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a methodology capturing both the formal representation of ASM with the ability to generate safety properties from the STPA hazard analysis. This has the advantages of verifying the STPA requirements in a formal way, and giving insights for the improvement of the ASM specification, depending on these requirements. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to an insulin pump control system case study, showing what safety issues it highlights. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

In this paper, we investigate the use case of a robotic care system as an application of autonomous multi-clouds. We present requirements and properties of an Abstract State Machines-based conceptual model that coordinates the multi-cloud interaction through the specification of a middleware exploiting adaptive interfaces to multiple clouds and supporting various service formats. While the multi-cloud system is running in normal mode, data about the execution will be gathered and evaluated by the monitoring component, and in case any critical situation is discovered the adaptation component is alerted.

  abstract               = {Distributed systems that exploit software services from multiple clouds provide opportunities for software systems that address problems associated with systems of systems. In this paper we present an approach for the conceptual modelling of such systems, which is grounded in a distributed middleware that coordinates the client access to multiple clouds through a concept of mediator. Furthermore, each component of the middleware constitutes an abstract machine that is realised by three layers: a layer for normal operation, a layer for monitoring and detection of critical situations, and an adaptation layer, which in case of an identified anomaly changes the normal behaviour. The semantics of this autonomous system can be captured by linguistic reflection, for which reflective Abstract State Machines will be exploited. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Such systems face a high-level of uncertainty as they consist of a large number of sensors, processing centers, and services deployed along a wide geographical area. Bringing together different resources poses increased complexity as well as communication efforts, and introduces a large set of possible failures and challenges of continuously growing computational and storage expectations. In such a frame, the role of the adaptation components is vital for ensuring availability, reliability, and robustness. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying the properties and behavior of the adaptation framework addressing the case of a system failure. We formalize the behavior and the collaboration mechanisms between agents of the system with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model.},

  abstract               = {The combination of agile methods and formal methods has been recognized as a promising field of research. However, many formal methods rely on a refinement-based development process which poses problems for their integration into agile processes. We consider redundancies within refinement hierarchies as a challenge for the practical application of stepwise refinement and propose superimposition-based modularization of refinement steps as a potential solution. While traditionally, each model in a refinement hierarchy must be developed and maintained separately, our concept allows developers to specify the refinement steps that transform a model into a refined one. We have developed tool support for the language AsmetaL and evaluated our approach by means of a case study. The results indicate a reduction of complexity for the development artifacts in terms of their overall size by 48.6% for the ground model and four refinements. Furthermore, the case study shows that superimposition-based refinement eases the development of alternative refinements for exploratory development and to cope with changing requirements. Thus, we consider this work as a step towards agile formal methods that are tailored to support iterative development, facilitating their incorporation into agile development processes. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

Such systems are characterized by high complexity and heterogeneity. Maintaining a high-level availability and a normal execution of the components implies precise monitoring and robust adaptation. Monitors capture relevant metrics and transform them to meaningful knowledge, which is further used in justifying adaptation actions. The current paper proposes an Abstract State Machine model for defining monitoring processes addressing failures and unavailability of the system nodes. The specification is simulated and validated with the aid of the ASMETA toolset. The solution is complemented with a small ontology reflecting the structure of the system.

Logical models are here presented as theories for implementation design on iDevice, with respect to the algebraic structure caused by state transitions. As a simpler design of complex AI, the environmental constraint is captured as a state, where the function applications are available at each state with the transition to the next states. For communication to the state, and function applications at the state, multi-modal logic model may be of use, where the formula or the condition monitors the state. Then interaction availability is significant, expressed in some algebra on the basis of the meaning definitions for formulas (conditions). By the state transition system, URL searching operations are now formally considered as in algebraic structure. The application of predicates to the states is regarded as applications of functions (transforming conditions) such that its algebraic structure may be given. © © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

They are deployed across large distributed systems and require a robust infrastructure. Their complex structure has been addressed numerous times in practice, but rarely in a formal manner. We propose in this paper a formal modeling approach for monitoring traffic systems and identifying possible failures of traffic sensors. Ensuring a safe and robust deployment and execution of services implies having a clear view on the system status, which is analysed by the monitoring framework. Our work focuses on availability aspects and makes use of the Abstract State Machines modeling technique for specifying the solution.

  abstract               = {The ever growing demands from the software area have led to the development of large-scale distributed systems which bring together a wide pool of services and resources. Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service, cost, and value. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, network and communication failures, and misbehavior. The current paper proposes a decision-based solution for the dynamic adaptation part of a middleware which addresses the aforementioned problems for large-scale distributed systems. The envisioned architecture is built on case-based reasoning principles and stands at the base of the adaptation processes that are imperative for ensuring the delivery of high-quality software. The solution is further extended through ground models with a focus on reliability, availability of components, and failure tolerance in terms of abstract state machines. The novelty of the approach resides in making use of formal modeling for one of the emerging problems and introducing an adequate prototype, on top of which one can apply reasoning and verification methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract            = {The evolution of Large-Scale Distributed Systems is strongly associated with the development of solutions for smart cities. They consist of a large-number of sensors, processing centers and services deployed in a wide geographical area. Due to their complexity and heterogeneity, such systems face a high-level of uncertainty and the failure of one node can affect the availability of the whole solution. Monitoring services collect data about the state of components and elaborate a diagnosis, aiming to increase the reliability of the system. This paper proposes an Abstract State Machine model to capture the properties and behavior of monitoring services addressing system failures. The method encompasses the translation of the requirements of the system to ground models. We discuss the formal solution with respect to the problem domain and execute a simulation of the model. We discuss the suitability of the method for distributed systems and compare it with other modeling approaches.},

  abstract            = {Up to recently the majority of applications of the Abstract State Machines method for design and verification of computational systems used the shared variable approach. However in particular with distributed systems only various forms of communication may be available to share information. We define communicating ASMs by using instead of shared locations an explicit, abstract concept of Sending/Receiving messages which can be added to existing ASM execution engines. We aim to provide a definition which is a conservative extension of traditional ASMs, uniformly captures synchronous and asynchronous communication and is not bound to any specific message passing mechanism but can be instantiated to the major communication concepts in the literature. We illustrate the concept by an application to synchronous and asynchronous networks of communicating processes. © J.UCS.},

The design of complex distributed self-adaptive systems having decentralized adaptation control by multiple interacting MAPE components is among the major challenges. In particular, formal methods for designing and assuring the functional correctness of the decentralized adaptation logic are highly demanded. This article presents a framework for formal modeling and analyzing self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a formalism, called self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, that exploits the concept of multiagent Abstract State Machines to specify distributed and decentralized adaptation control in terms of MAPE-K control loops, also possible instances of MAPE patterns. We support validation and verification techniques for discovering unexpected interfering MAPE-K loops, and for assuring correctness of MAPE components interaction when performing adaptation. © 2017 ACM.},

Due to the high importance of interlocking table at the design state of a signalization system, the modelling and verification of interlocking tables are examined in this work. For this purpose, abstract state machines are used as a modelling tool. The developed models have been performed in a generalized structure such that the model control can be done automatically for the interlocking systems. In this study, NuSMV is used at the verification state. Also, the consistency of the developed models has been supervised through fault injection.

  abstract               = {With the paradigm of aspect-orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program's logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Those aspect-oriented specifications often can be more easily reused than extensions that are implemented directly into an existing specification. Another use case is the extension of a specification with new functionality or features. Although this would be possible with refinement too, with aspect-orientation it is not necessary to augment the original specification with “extension points” that can be used for refinement. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect-oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented according to an aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. The applicability of aspect-oriented specification in the context of ASM is demonstrated by means of examples, e.g. implementing a fading aspect into the light control system specification of a former ASM case study. Finally, the paper gives a brief overview about the developed tool that supports the writing of aspect-oriented ASMs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

For its applicability to a wide range of programs we specify the transaction controller TACTL and the operator TA in terms of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This allows us to model concurrent updates at different levels of nested locations in a precise yet simple manner, namely in terms of partial ASM updates.

  abstract               = {Service-oriented computing is playing an important role in several domains. Today the biggest shift in mainstream design and programming is toward service-oriented applications. However, the service paradigm raises a bundle of problems that did not exist in traditional component-based development where abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity were the only main concerns. Due to their distributed, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature, service-oriented software applications require us to discover, document, and share new design patterns at the service- and architecture-level. Moreover, service-oriented applications are hard to design and validate, and demand for new foundational theories, modeling notations and analysis techniques. In line to such a vision, this article presents a framework, called SCA-PatternBox, to design and prototype service-oriented applications with design patterns. The framework relies on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) and on SCA component implementation types, such as SCA-Java, for supporting an “implementation-oriented” approach to service-oriented architecture modeling and to the definition and instantiation of design patterns. Moreover, in order to provide formally verified design patterns, SCA-PatternBox allows the formal specification and analysis of the functional behavioral aspects of a design pattern using a formal service specification language called SCA-ASM (Service Component Architecture-Abstract State Machine). As major evaluation of the framework, two case studies and lessons learned are presented. A final comparison of existing design pattern languages is also reported. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract               = {In this paper, we introduce a methodology to design robot-oriented generative learning objects (GLOs) that are, in fact, heterogeneous meta-programs to teach computer science (CS) topics such as programming. The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract               = {The request of formal methods for the specification and analysis of distributed systems is nowadays increasing, especially when considering the development of Cloud systems and Web applications. This is due to the fact that modeling languages currently used in these areas have informal definitions and ambiguous semantics, and therefore their use may be unreliable. Thanks to their mathematical foundation, formal methods can guarantee rigorous system design, leading to precise models where requirements can be validated and properties can be assured, already at the early stages of the system development. In this paper, we present a rigorous engineering process for distributed systems, based on the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formal method. We rely on the foundational notions of ASM ground model and model refinement to obtain a precise model for a client-server application for Cloud systems. This application has been proposed to tackle the problem of making Cloud services usable to different end-devices by adapting on-the-fly the content coming from the Cloud to the different devices contexts. The ASM-based modeling process is supported by a number of validation and verification activities that have been exploited on the component under development to guarantee consistency, correctness, and reliability properties. © 2016.},

Since the algorithm used for this computation is not Turing Machine reducible, neither is it Turing Machine describable, or describable by an equivalent formalism. That it is effective and mechanical, however, is intuitively obvious. I draw two conclusions. First, that there are calculators that are not isomorphic to Turing Machines and, so, the Church-Turing thesis, according to at least one interpretation, fails. The interpretation that is challenged is that all maximal models of computation are equivalent up to isomorphism to Turing Machines. Second, I draw the conclusion that the human brain/mind is not equivalent up to isomorphism to Turing Machines. Finally, I put forward a conjecture about why this might be so. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract               = {In this paper, we present an extension of the abstract state machines suited for the modelling of complex processors in the context of system verification. Besides processor simulation, the goal of our model is to provide a base for worst-case execution time estimation, providing abstraction capabilities that enable the scaling of analysis. The main difference between our model and other ASM extensions is that we define time as a mean to enable time accurate runs and hierarchical abstraction levels of components, while staying the closest possible to the original ASM mathematical foundation. The model is also designed to dynamically choose a suited component definition in order to adapt to information precision on data values. The time extension helps modelling non-instantaneous actions, which is essential for real-time systems. Adaptable precision and separation of the analysis from the model of the processor will prove well suited for integration into a worst-case execution time estimation tool. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

A challenging problem in requirements modeling for real-time embedded software is to devise an easy-to-use formal requirements modeling language and a corresponding requirements modeling approach. Timed Abstract State Machine, abbreviated as TASM, is an easy-to-use formal requirements modeling language, but it has its limitations. We have extended TASM. In this paper, we propose an extended TASM-based requirements modeling approach for real-time embedded software to identify the parallel and hierarchical components, and describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. We apply the proposed approach to model requirements of actual real-time embedded software to validate its effectiveness. Our study highlights several lessons for modeling requirements of real-time embedded software in the extended TASM. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.},

We take the abstract state machine (ASM) as operation semantics for formalising communication model when using IaaS platform services, which can show the changes of dynamic performance about the platform status. Meanwhile, we simplify the model without sacrificing the service correctness from user's perspective. Finally, we give the security attributes of cloud services and find some threats prone to service failure by using model checking tools UPPAAL to analyse the performance of current IaaS platform. This paper also provides a theory fundamental for the security enforcement of IaaS service and contributes to the prevailing of cloud computing. © © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  abstract               = {A behavioural theory consists of machine-independent postulates characterizing a particular class of algorithms or systems, an abstract machine model that provably satisfies these postulates, and a rigorous proof that any algorithm or system stipulated by the postulates is captured by the abstract machine model. The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. In addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first-order structures. The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every other tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on a purified Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) variant, the authors present proposals for several important issues in BPM that have not been adequately considered in the BPMN 2.0 standard. It focusses on modality as well as actor and user interaction modelling and offers an enhanced communication concept. In order to render models executable, the semantics of the modelling language needs to be described rigorously enough to prevent deviating interpretations by different tools. For this reason, the semantics of the necessary concepts introduced in this book are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method. Finally, the authors show how the different parts of the model fit together using a simple example process, and introduce the enhanced Process Platform (eP2) architecture, which binds all the different components together. The resulting method is named Hagenberg Business Process Modelling (H-BPM) after the Austrian village where it was designed. The motivation for the development of the H-BPM method stems from several industrial projects in which business analysts and software developers struggled with redundancies and inconsistencies in system documentation due to missing integration. The book is aimed at researchers in business process management and industry 4.0 as well as advanced professionals in these areas. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

  abstract               = {Abstract State Machines can be used to specify arbitrary system behaviour. However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g.,in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed. We illustrate how the control construct can improve the code’s readability on some examples. The proposed control construct is also released as a plugin for CoreASM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

Then we look at the plausibility of an ASM thesis for the class of RSAs, defining a model of abstract state machine (which we call reflective ASM) that we conjecture captures the class of RSAs as defined by our postulates. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

  abstract               = {The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a way to specify algorithms, applications and systems in a formal model. Recent ASM languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a specific environment. In this work-in-progress paper we outline a modelbased transformation approach supporting (1) the specification of applications or systems using the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language and (2) retargeting those applications to different programming language and hardware target domains. An intermediate model is introduced, which not only captures software-based implementations, but also the generation of hardware-related code in the same model. This approach offers a new formal modeling perspective onto modular, reusable and retargetable software and hardware designs for the development of embedded systems. We provide a short overview of our CASM compiler design as well as the retargetable model-based approach to generate code for different target domains. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper takes advantage of the Hemodialysis machine case study to present a formal development process supporting most of the engineering activities required by the standards, and provides rigorous approaches for system validation and verification.

  abstract               = {Model refinement is a technique indispensable for modeling large and complex systems. Many formal specification methods share this concept which usually comes together with the definition of refinement correctness, i.e., the mathematical proof of a logical relation between an abstract model and its refined models. Model refinement is one of the main concepts which the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method is built on. Proofs of correct model refinement are usually performed manually, which reduces the usability of the ASM model refinement approach. An automatic support to assist the developer in proving refinement correctness along the chain of refinement steps could be of extreme importance to improve, in practice, the adoption of ASMs. In this paper, we present how the integration between the ASMs and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) can be used to automatically prove correctness of model refinement for the ASM method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

A solution consists in having a middleware server that receives requests from the clients, forwards them to the cloud, and adapts the answers coming from the cloud on the base of device profiles. This paper proposes a formalization of this framework using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The modeling process is based on the ASMs refinement method, and has been guided and supported by several validation and verification activities to guarantee consistency, correctness, and reliability properties. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

Moreover, we do this without sacrificing the completeness of the logic for statements about single steps of non-deterministic parallel ASMs, such as invariants of rules, consistency conditions for rules, or step-by-step equivalence of rules. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

It is a kind of analysis where you start with a large semantically defined species of algorithms, and you finish up with a syntactic artifact, typically a computation model, that characterizes the species. The task of analyzing a large species of algorithms seems daunting if not impossible. As in quicksand, one needs a rescue point, a fulcrum. In computation analysis, a fulcrum is a particular viewpoint on computation that clarifies and simplifies things to the point that analysis become possible. We review from that point of view Turing’s analysis of human-executable computation, Kolmogorov’s analysis of sequential bit-level computation, Gandy’s analysis of a species of machine computation, and our own analysis of sequential computation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

This paper first proposes a formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The formal description for main artifact of the standard (function block) is presented in the paper. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model checker which is used to formally verify properties of applications developed in IEC 61499 standard. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the formal verification of the IEC 61499 control systems. The paper also highlights the other uses of verification such as portability of IEC 61499 based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The formal model is applied on an example IEC 61499 controller, and the SMV model for the Basic Function block is explained in detail. © 2015 IEEE.},

Mutation testing is a well-established fault-based technique for assessing and improving the quality of test suites. Mutation testing can be applied at different levels of abstraction, e.g., the unit level, the integration level, and the specification level. In this paper, we propose a suite of AsmetaL-specific mutation operators, classified into four categories. The proposed operators are used to assess the adequacy of test suites generated using the ATGT tool, according to various test coverage criteria. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through eight publicly available AsmetaL case studies. The results of the case studies show that our proposed mutation operators can be used to compare different AsmetaL-based test coverage criteria and successfully detect inadequacies in test suites. © 2015, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

  abstract            = {Trace-based JIT compilers identify frequently executed program paths at run-time and subsequently record, compile and optimize their execution. In order to improve the performance of the generated machine instructions, JIT compilers heavily rely on dynamic analysis of the code. Existing work treats the components of a JIT compiler as a monolithic whole, tied to particular execution semantics. We propose a formal framework that facilitates the design and implementation of a tracing JIT compiler and its accompanying dynamic analyses by decoupling the tracing, optimization, and interpretation processes. This results in a framework that is more configurable and extensible than existing formal tracing models. We formalize the tracer and interpreter as two abstract state machines that communicate through a minimal, well-defined interface. Developing a tracing JIT compiler becomes possible for arbitrary interpreters that implement this interface. The abstract machines also provide the necessary hooks to plug in custom analyses and optimizations. © 2015 ACM.},

In particular, we exploit the concept of multi-agent Abstract State Machines to specify decentralized adaptation control by using MAPE computations. We support techniques for validating and verifying adaptation scenarios, and getting feedback of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the MAPE-K loops. In particular, a verification technique based on meta-properties is proposed to allow discovering unwanted interferences between MAPE-K loops at the early stages of the system design.

  abstract            = {There is a general consensus on the importance of good requirements engineering for achieving high-quality software. Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while non-functional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language. We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis. We illustrate the applicability of our approach using a business process model (conference review process model) and a real-time system model (IP multicast routing case study). © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

A drawback of BPMN, however, is that modality is implicitly expressed through the structure of the process flow but not directly within the corresponding activity. Thus, an extension of BPMN with deontic logic has been proposed in previous work, called Deontic BPMN. Deontic BPMN reduces the structural complexity of the process flow and increases the readability by explicitly highlighting obligatory and permissible activities. In addition, an algebraic graph transformation from a subset of BPMN to Deontic BPMN, called Deontic BpmnGTS, has been defined. The goal of the current research is to show that DeonticBpmnGTS is terminating and confluent, resulting in a globally deterministic transformation. Moreover, the semantic equivalence of BPMN models and the respective Deontic BPMN models is proven based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Thus, DeonticBpmnGTS can be called a trusted model transformation. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We introduce Abstract State Machine Nets (ASM Nets) whose component ASMs can be defined using a simple combination of textual (data-oriented) and intuitive graphical (controlflow oriented) yet semantically rigorously defined descriptive means. This allows the BP experts to design BPMs whose underlying ASM Nets constitute a reliable precise contract-a contract which guarantees the BP domain experts that the application-domain focussed understanding of the BPMs they design is also a correct understanding of the code behavior provided by the implementation of the models by software experts. This paves the way for the development of certifiably correct BPMs and their implementations. To illustrate one practical and one conceptual application of the concept we a) instantiate ASM Nets to model the behavioral meaning of the graphical and textual notations used in the commercial S-BPM tool suite with its focus on communication (service interaction) and b) show that applying the rigorous ASM refinement concept to ASM Nets supports IBM's Guard-Stage-Milestone approach to adaptive case management by an accurate conceptual foundation. © 2015 ACM.},

A least fixed point formula may be available to denote states allowing interaction. A simple algebraic representation for interactive states can be definable. For communication between human and machinery, a modality is reserved. In applicative task domains, knowledge construction is focused on with respect to interactive action applications through communications. Panel touch behaviour on iDevice as practice, URL references as functions and grammatical rule applications for sequential effects are studied, as knowledge construction technologies. These views coherent with abstract state machine are finally related to recent trends as semiring in algebraic structure and coalgebra for streams as sequential knowledge structures. A refinement of interactive techniques is positioned into a formal approach to multi-modal logic, applicable to some practices. © © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Constraints imposed to such systems need to be thoroughly checked in order to ensure a proper service delivery to the client. The current paper proposes a monitoring solution for large-scale distributed systems relying on abstract state machines. Data gathered from the monitoring components are used in calculating metrics and establishing a diagnosis for the system. Emphasis is put on failure detection and on ensuring non-functional requirements of the system such as fault-tolerance and resilience. The model introduced in this paper will be integrated in a cloud-enabled large-scale distributed system. The novelty of the solution consists of finding the best integration architecture for state-of-the-art algorithms and tools and refining them to an efficient version for large-scale distributed systems © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

This paper proposes approach to formal modelling of IEC61499 function block execution semantics for popular model checking environment of SMV using Abstract State Machines. An operational semantics of IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model is presented using this framework. This paper first introduces the importance of model checking function block applications in different execution semantics. It highlights the uses of formal verification, such as, verifying portability (behavior) of component based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The formal model is applied on an example IEC 61499 application. The paper compares the verification results of this IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model and the same application with cyclic execution model presented in the earlier work. With this comparison, we verify the portability of the IEC61499 applications across different platforms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract            = {The Function Blocks Architecture of the IEC 61499 standard is an executable component model for distributed embedded control systems combining block-diagrams and state machines. The standard aims at the portability of control applications that is however hampered by ambiguities in its execution semantics descriptions. In recent years several execution models have been implemented in different software tools that generate mutually incompatible code. This paper proposes a general approach to neutralizing these semantic ambiguities by formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The model embodies all known execution semantics of function blocks. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model-checker which is used to verify formally properties of applications. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the portability checking of component-based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The paper first discusses different existing execution semantics of function blocks and the portability issues across different IEC 61499 tools. Then a modular formal model of function blocks’ operational semantics in ASM is introduced and exemplified in the paper by the cyclic execution semantics case for a composite function block. Subsequently, the SMV model is generated and model-checking is illustrated for a simple test case. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

Model transformation is widely used to extract a formal specification so that AADL models can be verified and analyzed by existing tools. Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) is a formalism not only able to specify behavior and communication but also timing and resource aspects of the system. To verify functional and nonfunctional properties of AADL models, this paper presents a methodology for translating AADL to TASM. Our main contribution is to formally define the translation rules from an adequate subset of AADL (including thread component, port communication, behavior annex and mode change) into TASM. Based on these rules, a tool called AADL2TASM is implemented using Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). Finally, a case study from an actual data processing unit of a satellite is provided to validate the transformation and illustrate the practicality of the approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

With the increasing interest research on understanding the mechanisms and processes through which learning occurs in FLOSS, there is an imperative to describe these processes. One successful way of doing this is through specification methods. In this paper, we describe the adoption of Abstract States Machines (ASMs) as a specification methodology for the description of learning processes in FLOSS. The goal of this endeavor is to represent the many possible steps and/or activities FLOSS participants go through during interactions that can be categorized as learning processes. Through ASMs, we express learning phases as states while activities that take place before moving from one state to another are expressed as transitions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Semantically, ambiguities can cause a lot of problems during the lifespan of a business process. As Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are grounded to subject orientation, we have explored their capabilities with respect to representing and executing Subject-oriented BPM (S-BPM) models. Based on the ASM method we implemented an interpreter which allows not only the proof of the S-BPM concept in terms of semantical preciseness, but also the automated execution of S-BPM models in terms of a workflow engine. This workflow engine serves as a baseline and reference implementation for further language and processing developments, such as simulation tools, as it has been developed within the Open-S-BPM initiative. This contribution focuses more on the use of the technique than on formal definitions. © The Author(s) 2015.},

  abstract            = {Model-based test generation consists in deriving system traces from specifications of systems under test. There exist several techniques for test generation, which, however, may suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we assume that the system under test can be divided in several subsystems such that only one subsystem is active at the time. Moreover, each subsystem decides when and to which other subsystem to pass the control, by also initializing the initial state of the next subsystem in a desired way. We model these systems and we show how it is possible to generate tests in a very efficient way that exploits the division of the entire system in subsystems. Test generation for the whole system is performed by visiting each subsystem and generating tests for it. The tests are combined in order to obtain valid system traces. We show how several visiting policies influence the completeness of the test generation process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The server model is focussed on the Request-Reply pattern, and specifies a delegation strategy where the handling of a request is entrusted to a module. We show how several major frameworks for web applications can be described as progressive refinements of a number of basic modules.

  abstract            = {Service-oriented Computing is rapidly gaining importance across several application domains due to its capability of composing autonomous and loosely-coupled services. In order to support the engineering of service-oriented software applications, foundational theories, service modeling notations, evaluation techniques fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach are required. This article introduces a framework for modeling and prototyping service-oriented applications. The framework consists of a precise and executable language, SCA-ASM, for model-based design, and of a tool for early and quick design evaluation of service assemblies. The language combines the OASIS/OSOA standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) capability of modeling and assembling heterogeneous service-oriented components in a technology agnostic way, with the rigor of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method able to model notions of service behavior, interactions, orchestration, compensation and context-awareness in an abstract but executable way. The tool is based on existing execution environments for ASM models and SCA applications. An SCA-ASM model of a service-oriented component, possibly not yet implemented in code or available as off-the-shelf, can be (i) simulated and evaluated offline, i.e. in isolation from the other components; or (ii) executed as abstract implementation (or prototype) together with the other components implementations according to the chosen SCA assembly. As proof of concept, a case study taken from EU research projects has been considered to show the functionalities and potentialities of the proposed framework. © 2013, British Computer Society.},

  abstract            = {It is well recognized that most of the anomalies, discovered in the development of embedded real-time systems, belong to requirement and specification phases. To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. For requirements development, especially requirements validation and verification, model-driven architecture techniques can be considered as a cost-efficient solution. In order to utilize such advantages, the design of the proposed system is often specified in terms of analyzable models at the certain level of abstraction. Further, different levels of requirements are translated into verifiable queries and fed into the models to be either validated or verified. For requirements management, requirements traceability provides critical support for performing change impact analysis, risk analysis, regression testing, etc. In this thesis, we cover several topics about requirements validation, requirements verification, and requirements traceability. In particular, the technical contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose an approach to requirements validation by using the extended Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined TASM constructs and, 2) we present a simulation-based method which is powered up by statistical techniques to conduct requirements verification, working with industrial applications and, 3) we introduce an improved VSM-based requirements traceability recovery approach using a novel context analysis. Further, we have demonstrated the applicability of our contributions in real world usage through various case studies. © 2014 IEEE.},

As such, they can perform arbitrary actions on arbitrary objects. Abstract State Machines (ASMs) work on a similar basis. Exploring their capabilities with respect to representing and executing S-BPM models strengthens the theoretical foundations of S-BPM, and thus, validity of S-BPM tools. Moreover it enables coherent intertwining of business process modeling with executing of S-BPM representations. In this contribution we introduce the framework and roadmap tackling the exploration of the ASM approach in the context of S-BPM. We also report the major result, namely the implementation of an executable workflow engine with an Abstract State Machine interpreter based on an existing abstract interpreter model for S-BPM (applying the ASM refinement concept). This workflow engine serves as a baseline and reference implementation for further language and processing developments, such as simulation tools, as it has been developed within the Open-S-BPM initiative. © 2014 IEEE.},

Metamodeling environments support syntactic definition issues, but they do not provide any help in defining the semantics of metamodels, which is usually given in natural language. In this chapter, the authors present an approach to formally define the semantics of metamodel-based languages. It is based on a translational technique that hooks to the language metamodel its precise and executable semantics expressed in terms of the Abstract State Machine formal method. The chapter also shows how different techniques can be used for formal analysis of models (i.e., instance of the language metamodel). The authors exemplify the use of their approach on a language for Petri nets. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {Service-oriented applications are dynamically built by assembling existing, loosely coupled, distributed, and heterogeneous services. Predicting their reliability is very important to appropriately drive the selection and assembly of services, to evaluate design feasibility, to compare design alternatives, to identify potential failure areas and to maintain an acceptable reliability level under environmental extremes. This article presents a model for predicting reliability of a service-oriented application based on its architecture specification in the lightweight formal language SCA-ASM. The SCA-ASM component model is based on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method Abstract State Machines for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. The proposed method provides an automatic and compositional means for predicting reliability both at system-level and component-level by combining a reliability model for an SCA assembly involving SCA-ASM components, and a reliability model of an SCA-ASM component. It exploits ideas from architecture-based and path-based reliability models. A set of experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its comparison with a state-of-the art BPEL-based approach. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In a first stage, we employed the Plural tool, which is designed to perform lightweight verification of Java programs using a data-flow analysis (DFA) framework, to specify and verify the MTTS. We wrote the Plural specification for the MTTS based on the code developed by Novabase, its informal documentation, and our discussions with Novabase engineers, who validated our understanding of the MTTS application. The Plural specification language is based on typestates and access permissions. In a second stage, we developed the Pulse tool, which enhances the analysis performed by Plural, and used the tool on the MTTS specifications. Pulse translates Plural specifications into an abstract state-machine model that captures the semantics of all the possible concurrent programs implementing the given specifications, and uses the evmdd-smc symbolic model checker to verify the machine model. The experimental results on the MTTS specification show that the exhaustive model-checking approach scales reasonably well and is efficient at finding errors in specifications that were not previously detected with the data-flow analysis (DFA) capabilities of Plural. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, nondeterminism in the specification usually affects performances of those operational methods that explicitly represent all the possible conformant states. In this paper, we tackle the problem of dealing with nondeterminism in an operational runtime verification approach based on the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We propose an SMT-based technique in which ASM computations are symbolically represented and conformance verification is performed by means of satisfability checking. Experiments show that, in most of the cases, the symbolic approach performs better than a technique for ASM-based runtime verification explicitly representing the conformant states. © Automated Verification of Critical Systems 2014.},

  abstract            = {With the paradigm of aspect orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Another use case for aspect orientation in specifications is the extension of specifications without touching the original ones. The definition of formal semantics for UML profiles without changing the original UML specification is an example for this application. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented with aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

Model-based formal methods can provide a cost-effective solution to requirements validation in a wide range of domains such as safety-critical applications. In this paper, we extend a formal language Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) with two newly defined constructs Event and Observer, and propose a novel requirements validation approach based on the extended TASM. Specifically, our approach can: 1) model both functional and non-functional (e.g. timing and resource consumption) requirements of the system at different levels and, 2) perform requirements validation by utilizing our developed toolset and a model checker. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in real world usage through an industrial case study of a Brake-by-Wire system. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

However, still with the current version 2.0 of BPMN, problems and contradictions with the underlying semantics of the meta-model can be identified. This paper shows an alternative approach for modeling the BPMN meta-model, using behavior-based decomposition. The focus in this paper is on control flow. We use Abstract State Machines (ASM) to describe the decomposition of the merging and splitting behavior of the different BPMN flow node types, such as parallel, exclusive, inclusive and complex, as defined in the BPMN 2.0 standard, resulting in behavior patterns. Furthermore an example for the composition of different gateway types is given using these behavior patterns.},

  abstract               = {Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is an architecture description language standard for embedded real-time systems widely used in the avionics and aerospace industry to model safety-critical applications. To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (TTS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose). Finally, the verified transformation is mechanized in the theorem prover Coq. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In previous work we have introduced the Identity Management Machine (IdMM) which is designed to handle the interaction between a client's identity directory and various cloud identity management systems. We now further refine this machine by describing its interaction with various cloud authentication systems. The IdMM is designed to aid SMEs in their adoption or migration to cloud-based services. The system allows SMEs to store its confidential data on-premise, enhancing the client's control over the data. We further enhance the privacy related aspects of a client-to-cloud interaction via the introduction of obfuscated and partially obfuscated identities which allow SMEs to also choose the type of data being sent to a cloud service. Since the IdMM is a single sign-on system capable of automatic authentication the risk of phishing or other social engineering attacks is reduced as an individual user may not be aware of his or her credentials for a given cloud service. © J.UCS.},

With increasing complexity of software-intensive computer-based systems and the challenges of validation and verification of abstract software models prior to coding, the need for interactive software tools supporting executable formal specifications is even more evident.

This paper seeks to explore the boundaries of the ideas of computation and provide a framework for enabling a constructive discussion of computational ideas. First, a review of computing is given, ranging from Turing Machines to interactive computing. Then, a variety of natural physical systems are considered for their computational qualities. From this exploration, a framework is presented under which all dynamical systems can be considered as instances of the class of abstract computational platforms. An abstract computational platform is defined by both its intrinsic dynamics and how it allows computation that is meaningful to an external agent through the configuration of constraints upon those dynamics. It is asserted that a platform's computational expressiveness is directly related to the freedom with which constraints can be placed. Finally, the requirements for a formal constraint description language are considered and it is proposed that Abstract State Machines may provide a reasonable basis for such a language.},

Two main abstraction levels are introduced in this paper to show a possible classification of abstraction levels of a formal specification. Furthermore, the basic differences and basic transition guidelines between those levels are discussed. A small example of the proposed two main abstraction levels is shown on a high-level specification of a potential transition machine to outline the intended transition process, typical appearance of abstraction level stages and refinement patterns. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Modern networking technologies, such as Cloud or SOA, enable cooperations and individuals to form dynamic coalitions for temporary sharing of resources and information in order to achieve a common goal. In recent years the need for a formal understanding of the structures, the dynamic aspects and the processes of these coalitions has grown. In my ongoing thesis I propose a formal framework based on the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in order to grasp and characterize dynamic coalitions in general and privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions in particular. The ASM formalism allows for a structural description of dynamic coalitions as well as for a formalization of the inherent processes by means of ASM-runs, thereby enabling simulation, testing, and verification possibilities for the design of supporting architectures. This paper shows how the CoreASM-toolset is used to develop an abstract model of dynamic coalitions and extended to integrate trust-based access control mechanisms in order to enforce privacy aspects in highly dynamic coalitions. Finally an ongoing case study is introduced and first insights to the usability of the proposed model are given. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Purpose: A major problem of business process modelling languages that primarily express the flow of activities is the limited support for actor modelling provided by rigid swimlane concepts. Thus, the aim of this work is to present a general approach for actor modelling in business processes that supports different layers of abstraction, thereby increasing the expressiveness and avoiding inaccuracy and redundancy. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed actor modelling approach supports task-based assignment of actors and roles based on deontic logic and speech act theory. The semantics of the approach is formally specified based on abstract state machines. Findings: The new approach for actor modelling is more expressive and provides the possibility to reduce the structural complexity of the process flow as shown by a case study and a comparison of an ordinary business process modelling approach using swimlanes and the actor modelling approach based on the workflow resource patterns. In particular, the evaluation showed that important patterns such as separation of duties and retain familiar are only supported by the actor modelling approach. Research limitations/implications: The research is to some degree in the context of the business process model and notation as a representative of a business process modelling language using swimlanes. Originality/value: Different gradations concerning the extent to which actor modelling is supported make the new approach outstanding for modelling activities, actors, and constraints in an expressive and legible way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

No determinism poses several challenges for the validation and verification activities, including the problem of inconclusive tests in model-based testing with model checker. It is a validation technique that uses model checker counterexamples as test cases. In this paper, we tackle the problem of testing nondeterministic systems by combining model-based testing and runtime conformance monitoring: the input sequences of the tests are automatically generated from nondeterministic models, then their execution is runtime monitored to check conformance of the code w.r.t. its specification. This technique provides an oracle for the test data, it never bears inconclusive responses, and it allows measuring the requirement coverage. The approach uses the Abstract State Machines as formal method for specification purposes and Java as implementation language. As a proof of concepts, the Tic-Tac-Toe game is taken as example of a system with nondeterministic behavior (both at specification and code levels). © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Sensor-based reactive and hybrid approaches have proven a promising line of study to address imperfect knowledge in grasping and manipulation. However the reactive approaches are usually tightly coupled to a particular embodiment making transfer of knowledge difficult. This paper proposes a paradigm for modeling and execution of reactive manipulation actions, which makes knowledge transfer to different embodiments possible while retaining the reactive capabilities of the embodiments. The proposed approach extends the idea of control primitives coordinated by a state machine by introducing an embodiment independent layer of abstraction. Abstract manipulation primitives constitute a vocabulary of atomic, embodiment independent actions, which can be coordinated using state machines to describe complex actions. To obtain embodiment specific models, the abstract state machines are automatically translated to embodiment specific models, such that full capabilities of each platform can be utilized. The strength of the manipulation primitives paradigm is demonstrated by developing a set of corresponding embodiment specific primitives for object transport, including a complex reactive grasping primitive. The robustness of the approach is experimentally studied in emptying of a box filled with several unknown objects. The embodiment independence is studied by performing a manipulation task on two different platforms using the same abstract description. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Further we present a refinement of the models to cycle-accurately describe two implementations of the classic 5-stage MIPS pipeline. Utilizing symbolic execution allows us to prove semantic equivalence of the pipeline implementations and the instruction set description. Finally we compile the models to C++ and provide a small runtime to create a system simulator achieving a performance of approx. 1 MHz in MiBench and SPECInt2000 benchmarks. © 2013 ACM.},

  abstract               = {The Abstract State Machine (ASM) formalism has proved an effective and durable foundation for the formal semantics of SDL. The distributed ASMs that underpin the SDL semantics are defined in terms of agents that execute ASM programs concurrently, acting on partial views of a global state. The discrete identities of successive global states are ensured by allowing input from the external world only between steps, and by having all agents refer to an external global time. But distributed systems comprising independent agents do not have a natural global time. Nor do they have natural global states. This paper takes well-known concepts from relativity and applies them to ASMs. The spacetime in which an ASM exists and moves is defined, and some properties that must be preserved by transformations of the frame of reference of an ASM are identified. Practical implications of this approach are explored through reservation and web service examples. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

A novel feature for ASM based languages is symbolic execution, which we briefly describe. CASM is used for instruction set simulator generation and for semantic description in a compiler verification project. We report on the experience of using the language in those two projects. Finally we position ASM based programming languages as an elegant combination of imperative and functional programming paradigms which may liberate us from the von Neumann style as demanded by John Backus. © Gesellschaft für Informatik, Bonn 2013.},

  abstract            = {Recently, sequence diagrams have been extended with the introduction of a set of operators in the latest specification of the Unified Modeling Language 2 (UML 2). Embedded in combined fragments, these operators are intended to simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of its events. However, the latest specification introduces a non-trivial degree of ambiguity in the interpretation and understanding of sequence diagrams. As these diagrams are increasingly adopted as modeling tools in embedded software, their ambiguity can exacerbate the challenges encountered in embedded system design. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of the loop, break and strict operators in sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and their related constraints. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {The latest specification of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.x revised completely the structure and elements of sequence diagrams by expanding their modularity via interaction fragments. These fragments are based on a set of operators that can simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of events in the diagram. Unfortunately, the new revision introduced a significant degree of ambiguity in the interpretation of these diagrams. This ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that different styles of sequence diagrams can be used for different purposes of modeling and analysis. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. The approach in this paper assumes that lifeline processes in a sequence diagram act as autonomous agents that communicate by exchanging messages among each other in asynchronous and distributed manner. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and constraints. © 2013 ACM.},

Yet a substantial share of business processes is difficult to predict with exceptions to the core processes occurring frequently. This contribution proposes to explicitly consider exceptions and handle them according to their degree of standardized behavior. A methodology comprising three main components provides guidance for this new perspective on exceptions: (1) a classification details the types of exceptions that are encountered in real-world S-BPM projects. (2) An approach inspired by the exception handling mechanisms in software engineering advises methods and tools for handling the exception types and suggests a corresponding escalation mechanism. Both the classification and the procedure model are validated by ten domain experts. (3) The S-BPM notation is extended in order to effectively leverage the proposed approach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Techniques to assure the quality of these applications are thus needed in order to identify in advance possible faults. Model-driven approaches to the testing of Web Applications can provide developers with a way of checking the conformance of the actual Web Application with respect to the model built from the requirements. These approaches can be used to automatically generate from the model a set of test cases satisfying certain coverage criteria, and thus can be integrated in a classical test driven development process. In this paper we present an automated technique for Web Application testing using a model-driven approach. We present a way of modeling Web Applications by Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and a process for generating automatically from the model a concrete test suite that is executed on the Web Application under test in order to check the conformance between the application and the model. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

For a complete definition of a DSL, both syntactic and semantic aspects of the language have to be specified. Metamodeling environments support syntactic definition issues, but they do not provide any help in defining the semantics of metamodels, which is usually given in natural language. In this chapter, the authors present an approach to formally define the semantics of metamodel-based languages. It is based on a translational technique that hooks to the language metamodel its precise and executable semantics expressed in terms of the Abstract State Machine formal method. The chapter also shows how different techniques can be used for formal analysis of models (i.e., instance of the language metamodel). The authors exemplify the use of their approach on a language for Petri nets. © 2013, IGI Global.},

This paper presents an approach to predict the reliability of a service component architecture. We adopt a lightweight formal component model, SCA-ASM, as core modeling technique for both architecture and behavior, supported by a run-time platform. This component model is based on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method Abstract State Machines for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. The proposed reliability prediction method exploits ideas from architecture-based and path-based reliability models. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Large-scale service-oriented computing is based on the idea that services from various servers are combined into one distributed application. For this the notion of service mediator has been coined, which captures specifications of composed services with slots that have to be filled by actual services. Such mediators can be specified by expressions in Kleene algebras with tests (KATs) or equivalently by very restricted Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this paper we address the refinement of such specifications with the intention to capture more meaningful conditions on the service slots and to fine-tune the matching of the slots with actual services. In particular, we investigate refinements that express user preferences thus leading to personalised mediators. For this form of adaptivity a previously developed term rewriting approach on KATs is generalised to refinements on ASMs. © 2012 IEEE.},

We decompose the client to cloud interaction into three distinct scenarios and introduce a set of ASM rules for each of them. We first consider a direct client to cloud interaction where the identity information stored on the client side is mapped to the identity created on the cloud provider's IdM system. To enhance privacy we then introduce the concept of real, obfuscated and partially obfuscated identities. Finally we take advantage of the increase in standardization in IdM systems defining the rules necessary to support authentication protocols such as OpenID. Our solution makes no supposition regarding the technologies used by the client and the cloud provider. Through abstract functions we allow for a distinct separation between the IdM system of the client and that of the cloud or service provider. Since a user is only required to authenticate once to our system, our solution represents a client centric single sign-on mechanism for the use of cloud services. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

By continuity, the value of the functional on a given function depends only on a "critical" finite part of this function. Care: there is in general no way to compute this critical finite part without querying the function on an arbitrarily larger finite part! Nevertheless, things are different in case there is a uniform bound on the size of the domain of this critical finite part. We prove that, modulo a quadratic blow-up of the bound, one can compute the value of the functional by an algorithm which queries the input function on a uniformly bounded finite part. Up to a constant factor, this quadratic blow-up is optimal. We also characterize such functionals in topological terms using uniformities. As an application of these results, we get a topological characterization of the dynamics of algorithms as modeled by Gurevich's Abstract State Machines. © 2012 IEEE.},

Hence, it is desirable to find a proper solution to specify different systems through these architectures. Abstract state machine (ASM) is a useful means to visually and formally model pub-sub and event-based architectures. However, modeling per se is not enough since the designers want to be able to verify the designed models. As the model checking is a proper approach to verify software and hardware systems, in this paper, we present an approach to verify ASM models specified in terms of Asmeta language using Bogor-a well known model checker. In our approach, the AsmetaL specification is automatically encoded to BIR, the input language of the Bogor. Our experimental results show that in the most cases our approach generates more efficient results in comparison with the existing approach. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

ASMs possess well-defined formal semantics for sequential and parallel computation, and their composition. We extend ASMs to support the specification of timing requirements, which we call timed constructs. We also describe the composition of timed constructs with sequential and parallel computation. A key contribution of this paper is the extension of the force-directed scheduling algorithm to support both parallel and timed constructs. We implement the synthesis back-end in synASM that targets FPGAs. Our experiments show improvements of up to 52% in lookup table usage and 34% in total area for certain examples. © 2012 IEEE.},

However, for a family of systems that can be easily decomposed in sub-systems, we devise a technique to cope with this problem. To model such systems, we introduce the notion of sequential net of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which represents a system constituted by a set of ASMs such that only one ASM is active at every time. Given a net of ASMs, we first generate a test suite for every ASM in the net, then we combine the tests in order to obtain a test suite for the entire system. We prove that, under some assumptions, the technique preserves coverage of the entire system. We test our approach on a benchmark and we report a web application example for which we are able to generate complete test suites. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Translation validation is one approach for compiler verification. A common semantic framework to represent source and target language is needed and Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are a well suited and established method. In this paper we present a method to show correctness of instruction selection by performing fully automated simulation proofs over symbolic execution traces of state transformations using an automated first-order theorem prover. We applied this approach to an industrial-strength compiler and created the ASM models in such a way that we are able to reuse them to create a cycle-accurate simulator. To achieve fast simulation we compile the ASM models to C++ and present the compilation scheme in this paper. Finally we present our preliminary results which indicate that a unified ASM model is sufficient for proving correct instruction selection and generating efficient cycle-accurate simulators. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

This highly iterative process builds on stepwise refinement of ground models that evolve with progressing understanding of functional system requirements. Usually, as complexity increases, reorganization of a model's internal structure helps enhance its flexibility and robustness. While this approach is common practice, the underlying principles are usually left implicit. In this paper, we propose refactoring patterns to restructure abstract machine models with the goal of improving their intelligibility and maintainability. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Based on the information obtained from code execution and model simulation, the conformance of the concrete implementation is checked with respect to its formal specification given in terms of Abstract State Machines. At runtime, undesirable behaviors of the implementation, as well as incorrect specifications of the system behavior are recognized. The technique we propose makes use of Java annotations, which link the concrete implementation to its formal model, without enriching the code with behavioral information contained only in the abstract specification. The approach fosters the separation between implementation and specification, and allows the reuse of specifications for other purposes (formal verification, simulation, model-based testing, etc.). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

This paper generalises this work by permitting unbounded parallelism on the algorithmic part of the state as well. The "parallel DB-ASM"-thesis results from combining Gurevich's parallel ASM thesis with the DB-ASM thesis. In doing so, it turns out that the postulates for synchronous parallel database transformations can be significantly simplified compared with the seminal work of Gurevich. The key idea is to generalise the notion of bounded exploration witnesses allowing them to include special non-ground terms. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

They introduce a typed approach to workflow specification in order to improve flexibility in business process technology by proposing a concept for integrating workflow definition and dialogue programming, being also open to business process modelling. Although their precursor has its semantic specification based on Unified Modelling Language semantics, workflow charts currently lack a complete formal semantic specification. Instead of enhancing the Unified Modelling Language semantics, the approach of specifying the semantics of workflow charts using the formalism of Abstract State Machines has been chosen. The resulting description provides a precise operational semantics.},

This paper introduces how to develop DSLs using the conceptbased development method. The development processes of DSLs using it can be divided into two phases: the first phase is to define and specify concepts which are basic units of DSLs; the second phase is to assemble DSLs with the concepts. The two phases are independent; therefore, a DSL can be implemented by domain experts and language experts together. on the basis of this idea, a metalanguage, DD, is defined for specifying DSLs. Each concept is defined as an independent module, which can help to improve the reusability of the DSLs developments. The concepts of the DSLs are divided into two kinds: element concepts and complement concepts, which makes the definitions of DSLs more flexible. In addition, attribute grammars and evolving algebras are used to specify the semantics of DSLs, which makes the specifications intuitive.},

To do it authors consider abstract state machines as models of classical computational systems. This class of machines is refined by introducing constrains on a state structure, namely, it is assumed that state of computational process has two components: a control unit state and a memory state. Then authors modify the class of models by substituting the deterministic evolutionary mechanism for a stochastic evolutionary mechanism. This approach can be generalized to the quantum case: one can replace transformations of a classical memory with quantum operations on a quantum memory. Hence the authors come to the need to construct a mathematical model of an operation on the quantum memory. It leads them to the notion of an abstract quantum automaton. Further the authors demonstrate that a quantum teleportation process is described as evolutionary process for some abstract quantum automaton.},

In this paper we propose Parallel Abstract State Machines (P-ASMs) that can empower programmers, no matter how experienced, by providing a well-founded systems engineering method to model data-parallel computations at arbitrary levels of abstraction. Particularly, we focus on discussing how P-ASMs can capture two classes of data-parallel computations that are most important in practice - ones that are always-consistent and ones that require transactional data consistency. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The user then specifies each component of the system architecture using UML inspired state machines, and refines/transforms these (abstract) state machines into concrete state machines. It is shown that if the abstract specification adheres to the security requirements, then so does the concrete one provided that certain conditions are satisfied. © 2012, IGI Global.},

Realistic situation analysis scenarios routinely deal with situations involving multiple mobile agents reacting to discrete events distributed in space and time. SADS system engineering practices call for systematic formal modeling approaches to manage complexity through modularization, refinement and validation of abstract models. We explore here SADS system design based on ASM modeling techniques paired with CoreASM tool support to facilitate analysis of the problem space and reasoning about design decisions and conformance criteria so as to ensure they are properly established and well understood prior to building the system. We provide an extension to CoreASM for the Marine Safety & Security domain, specifically for capturing rendezvous scenarios. The extension yields the necessary background concepts, such as mobile sensors and shipping lanes, and offers runtime visualization of simulation runs together with an analyzer to measure success of various rendezvous detection strategies used in the model. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach using a sample rendezvous scenario. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

This is largely due to the intricacy of the analog behavioral intent which cannot be captured purely in terms of logic. In this paper, we show that by using auxiliary forms of formal specifications such as abstract state machines and real-valued functions, called auxiliary functions, as references for AMS assertions, it becomes possible to model complex AMS behavioral properties. In addition, we present complexity results for the satisfiability problem of such specifications. This approach leverages the growing adoption of AMS behavioral modeling in the industry. This paper also shows that the use of auxiliary state machines allows us to separate out the scope of different analog assertions leading to significant performance gains in the assertion checking overhead. © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Virtual Environments can be considered as asynchronous distributed systems with static and highly dynamic aspects. Despite a number of available design tools, the dynamic aspects, behaviour and interaction, are mainly designed and developed with ad hoc solutions utilizing high-level programming or scripting languages without any engineered design procedure. This leads to neither reusable nor readable solutions letting design of dynamic in Virtual Environments still a complex and time-consuming task. In this work the Asynchronous Multi-Agent Abstract State Machine model is analyzed. Its suitability to the design of dynamic aspects of Virtual Environments is evaluated in order to put the basis to the development of a design methodology unifying the intuitiveness of Agent Based Modeling with the Abstract State Machine theoretical foundations and well defined methodology. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for the generation of test-cases for marine safety & security scenarios. The conceptual design issues including the main requirements, the architecture, and other detailed design issues of the proposed system are discussed. We also propose a formal representation of test-cases using the Abstract State Machine method and illustrate the approach by means of simple examples. © 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper we present a proof system for DB-ASMs. It is shown that the proof system for DB-ASMs is sound. As DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers over only the database part of a state which is a finite structure, we can formalise non-determinism of DB-ASMs by utilising a modal operator [] for an update set or multiset generated by a DB-ASM rule. In doing so, we lay down a solid foundation for the completeness proof of the proof system proposed for DB-ASMs in this paper. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract               = {ASM refinements are verified using generalized forward simulations which allow us to refine m abstract operations to n concrete operations with arbitrary m and n. One main difference from data refinement is that ASM refinement considers infinite runs and termination. Since backward simulation does not preserve termination in general, the standard technique of adding history information to the concrete level is not applicable to get a completeness proof. The power set construction also adds infinite runs and is therefore not applicable either. This paper shows that a completeness proof is nevertheless possible by adding infinite prophecy information, effectively moving nondeterminism to the initial state. Adding such prophecy information can be done not only on the semantic level, but also by a simple syntactic transformation that removes the choose construct of ASMs. The completeness proof is also translated to a completeness proof for IO automata. Finally, the proof is extended to deal with supplementary predicates, that specify fairness and liveness assumptions, by transferring a related result of Wim Hesselink for refinements that use the AbadiLamport setting. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract               = {The analysis and verification of an AADL model usually requires its transformation into the meta-model of this model-checker or that schedulability analysis tool. However, one challenging problem is to prove that the transformation into the target model of computation (MoC) preserves the semantics of the original AADL model or at least some of its properties. Moreover, the AADL standard lacks a formal semantics to make the validation of this translation possible. Albeit some of the related works give informal explanations on the model transformations they apply to interpret or compile AADL, the formal proof of semantics preservation remains in most cases altogether impossible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for a synchronous subset of AADL, which includes periodic threads and data port communications. Its operational semantics is formalized as a TTS (Timed Transition System). This formalization is one prerequisite to the formal proof of semantics preservation for our model transformation from AADL sources to our target verification formalism: TASM (Timed Abstract State Machine). In this paper, an abstract syntax of (our subset of) AADL is given, together with the abstract syntax of TASM. The translation is formalized by a family of semantics functions, which associates each AADL construct to a TASM fragment. Then, the proof of simulation equivalence between the TTSs of the AADL and the TASM models is formalized and mechanized using the proof assistant Coq. © 2011 IEEE.},

We select the FDS algorithm because it maximizes the amount of resource sharing, and it naturally supports constructs for parallelism. However, timed constructs are not supported. As a result, we propose timed FDS (TFDS) that optimizes over parallel, timed and untimed constructs. In doing so, we make the following four contributions: 1) we extend the definition of control data flow graphs (CDFGs) to define timed CDFGs (TCDFGs), 2) we define a scheduling algorithm for timed constructs called TIME, 3) we extend the definition of mobility used in FDS, and 4) we present optimizations for a composition of parallel, timed and untimed constructs to better aid FDS. We implement our extensions in a high-level synthesis framework based on the abstract state machine formalism, and we generate synthesizable VHDL. We experiment with several examples such as FIR, edge detector, and a differential equation solver, and target them onto an Alter a DE2 FPGA. Some of these experiments show improvements of up to 52 in circuit area when compared to their unoptimized counterparts. © 2011 IEEE.},

While we specify our designs using ASMs, we do not mandate this. Instead, one can create translators that convert the algorithmic specifications from C-like languages into their equivalent ASM specifications. This makes the hardware synthesis transparent to the designer. We experiment our methodology with examples of a FIR, microprocessor, and an edge detecteor.

Based on the profile mechanism of unified modeling language (UML) 2.2, a kind of DSML is presented to model simulation testing systems of avionic software (STSAS). To define the syntax, semantics and notions of the DSML, the domain model of the STSAS from which we generalize the domain concepts and relationships among these concepts is given, and then, the domain model is mapped into a UML meta-model, named UML-STSAS profile. Assuming a flight control system (FCS) as system under test (SUT), we design the relevant STSAS. The results indicate that extending UML to the simulation testing domain can effectively and precisely model STSAS. © 2011 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics. All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {As research on developing assertion languages for the AMS domain gains in momentum, it is increasingly being felt that extensions of existing assertion languages like PSL and SVA into the AMS domain are not adequate for expressing the analog design intent. This is largely due to the intricacy of the analog behavioral intent which cannot be captured purely in terms of logic. In this paper we show that by using auxiliary forms of formal specifications such as abstract state machines and real valued functions as references for AMS assertions, it becomes possible to model complex AMS behavioral properties. This approach leverages the growing adoption of AMS behavioral modeling in the industry. The paper also shows that the use of auxiliary state machines allows us to separate out the scope of different analog assertions leading to significant performance gains in the assertion checking overhead. © 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper, the use of event driven architecture (EDA) as a platform for supporting event oriented applications in power control centers is presented. EDA operates on the semantics of events and event patterns, which are easy to decipher, flexible, extensible and conform to the standard. The concept is explained with real-time congestion management procedure recently introduced in Indian power sector. The semantics of events pertaining to real-time congestion management are defined in terms of states and state transitions of an abstract state machine. The state machine is then used to define a minimal set of basic and complex event patterns, which are implemented using an open source event processing tool. The results show that the congestion state of the system is correctly identified, and can be used as decision support. The case study is indicative of a wider set of event oriented applications that can be supported by EDA at control centers and constituents.},

OGSA includes several important capabilities needed to support Grid applications and, among them, the job management and execution capability, which concern searching candidate locations and executing and managing jobs until end. Such functionalities enable users to use distributed resources for their applications. These tasks are critical in the Grid system context because their incorrect execution can heavily affect provided services, so adoption of formal method is sometimes mandatory. This paper is aimed at defining an abstract model for specifying the job management and execution services. We propose a Distributed Abstract State Machine (DASM) model to analyse and design OGSA capability and its implementation in coreASM. © Civil-Comp Press, 2011.},

  abstract               = {This paper illustrates the theoretical basis of an approach to apply data flow testing techniques to abstract state machines (ASMs). In particular, we focus on multi-agent ASMs extended with the seq construct for turbo ASMs. We explain why traditional data flow analysis can not simply be applied to ASMs: data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph whereas in this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph.We revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis taking into account the specific, parallel nature of ASMs, and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. In particular, we analyze the role played by different types of terms in ASMs and deal with the problem of terms that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, terms that are shared between several agents, and derived terms. We also discuss what consequences the use of the turbo ASM construct seq has on our analysis and revise the approach accordingly. Finally, we specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria for this class of ASMs and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.

Compatibility of such partial updates to disjoint locations can be assured by applying applicative algebras. However, due to the arbitrary nesting of type constructors, locations of complex-value database are often defined at multiple abstraction levels and thereby non-disjoint. Thus, applicative algebras is not as smooth as its simple definition suggests. In this paper, we investigate this problem in the context of complex-value databases, where partial updates arise naturally in database transformations. We show that a more efficient solution can be obtained when generalising the notion of location and thus permitting dependencies between locations. On these grounds we develop a systematic approach to consistency checking for update sets that involve partial updates. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

After presenting our proposal in general terms, we discuss the modifications that it requires in the existing axiomatics of interactive sequential algorithms and in the existing syntax and semantics of abstract state machines. To make that discussion self-contained, we include a summary of this material before the modifications. Fortunately, only rather minor modifications are needed.© 2011 ACM.},

In this work, the multi-agent approach to design such systems is adapted so behaviors of agents are described in terms of abstract state machines. By constraining agent behaviors to deterministic machines, verification of resulting systems is expected to be more effective and, as a by-product, implementation of physical agents is more straight-forward. In this paper, the design framework is described as well as some preliminary tests to prove the viability of this approach. ©2010 IEEE.},

However, difficulties were often encountered when trying to formalize the complex underlying computations in security protocols. Some flaws of the security protocols, especially the ones that caused by the computations weakness, cannot be detected owing to the simple abstractions of its underlying computations. In this paper, we present a method to verify a key establishment protocol HMQV, where we propose a simple formalization of its underlying Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. The formal model of HMQV is verified by our newly released model checker ASM-SPV (Abstract State Machines-Security Protocol Verifier). Experiments show that the attacks (reported by Sarr et al.) can be found under the proposed formal model of HMQV by ASM-SPV. © 2010 IEEE.},

We aim to overcome two facts: 1) simulation is not identification, 2) the ASMs simulating machines of some type do not constitute a natural class among all ASMs. We modify Gurevich's notion of ASM to that of EMA ("Evolving MultiAlgebra") by replacing the program (which is a syntactic object) by a semantic object: a functional which has to be very simply definable over the static part of the ASM. We prove that very natural classes of EMAs correspond via "literal identifications" to slight extensions of the usual machine models and also to grammar models. Though we modify these models, we keep their computation approach: only some contingencies are modified. Thus, EMAs appear as the mathematical model unifying all kinds of sequential computation paradigms. © S. Grigorieff and P. Valarcher.},

We present a generic framework that tackles this problem using an incremental approach that interleaves model construction and verification. Our protocol models are based on abstract state machines formalized in Isabelle/HOL. We provide abstract building blocks and generic composition rules to support incremental addition of protocol features to a parameterized endpoint model. This structured approach controls model complexity. We can refine data structures and develop control independently, to create a concrete instantiation. To make the verification effort feasible, we combine interactive theorem proving with symbolic model checking using NuSMV. The theorem prover is used to reason about generic correctness properties of the abstract models given some local assumptions. We can use model checking to discharge these assumptions for a specific instantiation. We show the utility and breadth of the framework by sketching two case studies: modelling a bus protocol, and modelling the PCI Express point-to-point protocol. © 2010 FMCAD Inc.},

  abstract               = {Database transformations provide a unifying umbrella for queries and updates. In general, they can be characterised by five postulates, which constitute the database analogue of Gurevich's sequential ASM thesis. Among these postulates the background postulate supposedly captures the particularities of data models and schemata. For the characterisation of XML database transformations the natural first step is therefore to define the appropriate tree-based backgrounds, which draw on hereditarily finite trees, tree algebra operations, and extended document type definitions. This defines a computational model for XML database transformation using a variant of Abstract State Machines. Then the incorporation of weak monadic second-order logic provides an alternative computational model called XML machines. The main result is that these two computational models for XML database transformations are equivalent.},

The resulting service-oriented component model provides an ASM-based representation of both the structural and behavioral aspects of service-oriented systems, like service interactions, service orchestration, service tasks and compensation. The ASM formal description of a service-oriented system is suitable for rigorous execution-platform-independent analysis.},

The proof is based on a fixed point technique in lambda calculus and on Gurevich sequential Thesis which allows to identify sequential deterministic algorithms with Abstract State Machines. This extends to algorithms for partial computable functions in such a way that finite computations ending with exceptions are associated to finite reductions leading to terms with a particular very simple feature. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

That analysis, however, abstracted from details of intra-step computation, and the ASM, produced in the proof of the representation theorem, may and often does explore parts of the state unexplored by the algorithm. We refine the analysis, the axiomatization and the representation theorem. Emulating a step of the given algorithm, the ASM, produced in the proof of the new representation theorem, explores exactly the part of the state explored by the algorithm. That frugality pays off when state exploration is costly. The algorithm may be a high-level specification, and a simple function call on the abstraction level of the algorithm may hide expensive interaction with the environment. Furthermore, the original analysis presumed that state functions are total. Now we allow state functions, including equality, to be partial so that a function call may cause the algorithm as well as the ASM to hang. Since the emulating ASM does not make any superfluous function calls, it hangs only if the algorithm does. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Recently, this approach was extended to suggest axiomatic foundations for the notion of effective computation over arbitrary countable domains. This was accomplished in three different ways, leading to three, seemingly disparate, notions of effectiveness. We show that, though having taken different routes, they all actually lead to precisely the same concept. With this concept of effectiveness, we establish that there is - up to isomorphism - exactly one maximal effective model across all countable domains. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper presents a formal and executable se- mantic framework for UML4SOA models of service-oriented systems. The UML4SOA language is a UML profile de- veloped in the EU SENSORIA project for modeling services behavior focusing on service orchestration aspects. We com- plement the graphical model of a service orchestration sce- nario with a formal description that is suitable for rigorous execution-platform-independent analysis. We map the be- havioral primitives of UML4SOA activity diagrams into a particular class of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) able to model notions of service interactions and orchestrations.

  abstract               = {The aim of rendezvous in a graph is meeting of two mobile agents at some node of an unknown anonymous connected graph. The two identical agents start from arbitrary nodes in the graph and move from node to node with the goal of meeting. In this paper, we focus on rendezvous in trees, and, analogously to the efforts that have been made for solving the exploration problem with compact automata, we study the size of memory of mobile agents that permits to solve the rendezvous problem deterministically. Werst show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents is arbitrary, then the lower bound on memory required for rendezvous is Ω (log n) bits, even for the line of length n. This lower bound meets a previously known upper bound of O(log n) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary trees of size at most n. Our main result is a proof that the amount of memory needed for rendezvous with simultaneous start depends essentially on the number ℓ of leaves of the tree, and is exponentially less impacted by the number n of nodes. Indeed, we present two identical agents with O(log ℓ+log log n) bits of memory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at most n nodes and at most ℓ leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many leaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for rendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with delay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that Ω (log ℓ + log log n) bits of memory is required for rendezvous, even in the class of trees with degrees bounded by 3.},

The architecture of the ASM in Internetware was analyzed, the detailed operating rules on ASM were proposed, and the changes were introduced in system states. A supporting platform of Internetware design and operation began to take shape through the design and implementation according to the states, events, methods, data, and rules involved in ASM.

  abstract               = {Model programs are high-level behavioral specifications typically representing Abstract State Machines or ASMs. Conformance checking of model programs is the problem of deciding if the set of traces allowed by one model program forms a subset of the set of traces allowed by another model program. This is a foundational problem in the context of model-based testing, where one model program corresponds to an implementation and the other one to its specification. Here model programs are described using the ASM language AsmL. We assume a background containing linear arithmetic, sets, and tuples. We introduce the Bounded Conformance Checking problem or BCC as a special case of the conformance checking problem when the length of traces is bounded and provide a mapping of BCC to a theorem proving problem in . BCC is shown to be highly undecidable in the general case but decidable for a class of model programs that are common in practice. © 2010 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Most of the existing solutions are aiming at supporting application transparency (no checkpoint related code development in application), but some others build middleware transparent (no service modification) solutions. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a solution providing both application and middleware transparency at the same time. Compatibility and integrity requirements are identified and corresponding conditions are established using Abstract State Machines. The most relevant checkpointing systems are checked against the conditions in order to examine their conformity. Based on the conditions, a novel checkpointing method is defined and a proof of concept checkpointing tool, called TotalCheckpoint (TCKPT) is introduced. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As updates are fundamentally distinct from queries in many respects, computation models for queries cannot be simply extended to database transformations. This motivates the question whether Abstract State Machines (ASMs) can be used to characterise database transformations in general. In this paper we start examining the differences between database transformations and algorithms, which give rise to the formalisation of five postulates for database transformations. Then a variant of ASMs called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs) is developed, and we prove that DB-ASMs capture database transformations, i.e. the main result of the paper is that every database transformation stipulated by the postulates can be behaviourally simulated by a DB-ASM.},

  abstract               = {The exact validation of streaming XML documents can be realised by using visibly push-down automata (VPA) that are defined by Extended Document Type Definitions (EDTD). It is straightforward to represent such an automaton as an Abstract State Machine (ASM). In doing so we enable computations on abstract states that are defined by a certain class of automata, in this case VPAs. In this paper we elaborate on this approach by taking also updates of XML documents into account. In this way the ASM-approach combines vertical refinements, which first make states explicit and then instantiate by a specific EDTD, with horizontal refinements, which replace streaming XML documents by stored ones and then add updates. Furthermore, as the EDTD appears as part of the abstract state, updating it is another natural extension by horizontal refinement. In this way we obtain consistently integrated updates and schema updates for XML documents, which can even be extended to become fault-tolerant by taking at most k errors in the document into consideration. It further provides an example of ASM-based computation with automata-defined states. © J.UCS.},

Such functionalities appear at various levels of the infrastructure and in various means forming a blurry domain, where it is hard to see how the participating components are related and what their relevant properties are. In this paper we focus on a subset of these problems: resource brokering in Grid middleware. This paper aims at establishing a semantical model for brokering and related activities by defining brokering agents at three levels of the Grid middleware for resource, host and broker selection. The main contribution of this paper is the definition and decomposition of different brokering components in Grids by providing a formal model using Abstract State Machines. © A. Kertész & Zs.

  abstract            = {Most of the work on automated web service composition has focused so far on composition of stateful web services. This level of composition so-called "Process Level" considers web services with their internal and complex behaviors. At process level formal models such as State Transition Systems (STS from now) or Interface Automata are the most appropriate models to represent the internal behavior of stateful web services. However such models focus only on semantics of their behaviors and unfortunately not on semantics of actions and their parameters. In this paper, we suggest to extend the STS model, by following the WSMO based annotation for Abstract State Machine. This semantic enhancement of STS so called S<sup>2</sup>TS will enable to model semantics of internal behaviors and semantics of their actions together with their input and output parameters. Secondly, we will focus on automated generation of data flow (or the process to perform automated assignments between parameter of services involved in a composition). Thus we do not restrict to assignments of exact parameters (which is practically never used in industrial scenario) but extend assignments to semantically close parameters (e.g., through a subsumption matching) in the same ontology. Our system is implemented and interacting with web services dedicated to Telecommunication scenarios. The preliminary evaluation results showed high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract               = {Conventional computation models restrict to particular data structures to represent states of a computation, e.g. natural numbers, sequences, stacks, etc. Gurevich's Abstract State Machines (ASMs) take a more liberal position: any first-order structure may serve as a state. In [7] Gurevich characterizes the expressive power of sequential ASMs: he defines the class of sequential algorithms by means of only a few, amazingly general requirements and proves this class to be equivalent to sequential ASMs. In this paper we generalize Gurevich's result to distributed algorithms: we define a class of distributed algorithms by likewise general requirements and show that this class is covered by a distributed computation model based on sequential ASMs. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract            = {Software engineering uses UML diagrams as a standard technique for specification and development of software. Various UML diagrams are used for specification of different aspects of the application. Their interpretation, extension, revision and integration becomes awful difficult if developers use the full freedom of UML, apply their own semantics and do not agree an common parts. We propose an approach that limits this freedom to the necessary extend. Developers have the full freedom on parts of the specification that is independent from others and are committed to fulfill contracts on parts of the specification that is also used by other developers. Due to a lack of semantics the integration of various UML diagrams is often left to the intuition of software engineers, which bears the risk of UML-based software development becoming error-prone. In this paper we propose the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as a means to support the integration of UML diagrams by means of invertible translations of UML clusters, i.e. sets of UML diagrams together with constraints defined on them, into easily understandable ASM specifications. In doing so, the rigorous semantics of ASMs induces an unambiguous semantics for the UML clusters. These translations themselves can be formalised by ASM specifications thereby automating the translation process. Furthermore, the evolution of UML clusters is guarded by contracts, which can again by specified by ASMs. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Concepts like signal handling and interruptible activity regions were introduced. By using a token flow semantics for describing the execution, activities drift apart from state diagrams. Therefore, it is no more possible to apply verification techniques designed for state diagrams to activity diagrams. This problem is faced by introducing a transformation of activities into a state transition system covering the basic concepts of activity diagrams including but not limited to the aforementioned ones. © 2009 IEEE.},

This would help reduce the cost of later redesign activities in case of unsatisfactory performance. This paper presents a novel approach to perform schedulability analysis at the requirement stage using Timed Use Case Maps (TUCM) language. The proposed approach relies on the computation of Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET), resource allocation and scheduling policies. Timing and resource constraints are first incorporated into UCM specifications, then mapped to Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism and implemented in AsmL language, allowing for simulation and schedulability analysis. The applicability of the approach is illustrated using an example of the Automatic Protection Switching (APS) feature. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, meta-languages such as the MOF (Meta Object Facility)-combined with the OCL (Object Constraint Language) for expressing constraints-used to specify metamodels focus on structural and static semantics but have no built-in support for specifying behavioral semantics. This paper introduces a formal semantic framework for the definition of the semantics of metamodel-based languages. Using metamodelling principles, we propose several techniques, some based on the translational approach while others based on the weaving approach, all showing how the Abstract State Machine formal method can be integrated with current metamodel engineering environments to endow language metamodels with precise and executable semantics. We exemplify the use of our semantic framework by applying the proposed techniques to the OMG metamodelling framework for the behaviour specification of the Finite State Machines provided in terms of a metamodel. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We provide a new formal framework for algorithm level modelling-design modelling at a high abstraction level, focused exclusively on function and algorithms. The semantics of our models is based on Abstract State Machines with synchronous parallel execution, sequential execution, and nondeterminism. To express models we propose an executable, object-oriented Architecture Specification Language with rich data types and a well-defined formal semantics, based initially on Microsoft's AsmL. We describe an experimental framework for direct symbolic execution of models in this language, intended as a basis for both property and refinement verification, as well as design exploration. We explain and illustrate our approach through a case study, the modelling a simple μop scheduler and its refinement towards a design model for circuit implementation. We aim to show the utility of our language and symbolic execution framework for exploring microarchitectural algorithm and to validate designs using dynamic or formal techniques, yielding more productive convergence to high quality implementations. © 2009 Crown.},

  abstract               = {The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a popular language for architectural modeling and analysis of software intensive systems in application domains such as automotive, avionics, railway and medical systems. These systems often have stringent real-time requirements. This paper presents an extension to AADL's behavior model using time annotations in order to improve the evaluation of timing properties in AADL. The translational semantics of this extension is based on mappings to the Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM) language. As a result, timing analysis with timed simulation or timed model checking is possible. The translation is supported by an Eclipse-based plug-in and the approach is validated with a case study of an industrial production cell system. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, compared to the testing of functional requirements, these techniques are not prevalent that much in testing software security. This paper presents a model-based approach to automatic testing of attack scenarios. An attack testing framework is proposed to model attack scenarios and test the system with respect to the modeled attack scenarios. The techniques adopted in the framework are applicable in general to the systems, where the potential attack scenarios can be modeled in a formalism based on extended abstract state machines. The attack events, i.e., attack test vectors chosen from the attacks happening in real-world are converted to the test driver specific events ready to be tested against the attack signatures. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the most common attack scenarios. The framework is useful to test software with respect to potential attacks which can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

We revise the concepts of function definition, use in predicate, and use in computation accordingly, and show how definition-use paths are specified in these cases. Finally, we propose a model-checking based approach to derive automatically test cases satisfying a given set of data flow coverage criteria. © 2009 Crown Copyright.},

For modeling reactive systems, one uses input-output model programs, where the action vocabulary is divided between two conceptual players: the input player and the output player. The players share the action vocabulary and make moves that are labeled by actions according to their respective model programs. Conformance between the two model programs means that the output (input) player only makes output (input) moves that are allowed by the input (output) players model program. In a bounded game, the total number of moves is fixed. Here model programs use a background theory T containing linear arithmetic, sets, and tuples. We formulate the bounded game conformance checking problem, or BGC, as a theorem proving problem modulo T and analyze its complexity. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

The systems to which the method can be applied are composed of many identical node processes that run in parallel with a controller process. Refinement checks on the abstract state machine can be performed automatically in the traces and stable failures models using the FDR model checker.

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of a (self-stabilizing) infrastructure such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system for their execution. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this article, we present our design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler. The compiler we designed and implemented transforms programs written in a language similar to the abstract state machine (ASM). The compiler preserves the stabilization property of the high level program. © 2009 ACM.},

  abstract               = {On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems deal with analytical tasks that support decision making. As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data required by OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. However, user requirements for OLAP systems change over time. Data warehouses and OLAP systems thus are rather dynamic and the design process is continuous. In order to easily incorporate new requirements and at the same time ensure the quality of the system design, we suggest to apply the Abstract State Machine (ASM) based development method. This assumes we capture the basic user requirements in a ground model and then apply stepwise refinements to the ground model for every design decisions or further new requirements. In this article, we show that a systematical approach which is tailored for data warehouse design with a set of formal refinement rules can simplify the work in dynamic data warehouse design and at the same time improves the quality of the system. © J.UCS.},

  abstract               = {Scientific and business communities present unprecedented requirements on provenance, where the provenance of some data item is the process that led to that data item. Previous work has conceived a computer-based representation of past executions for determining provenance, termed process documentation, and has developed a protocol, PReP, to record process documentation in service oriented architectures. However, PReP assumes a failure free environment. Failures lead to process documentation unable to be recorded, losing the evidence that a process occurred. This is not acceptable in the applications relying on process documentation and would cause disastrous consequences. This paper describes our solution, F-PReP, a protocol for recording process documentation in the presence of failures. A complete formalisation of the protocol using Abstract State Machines is also presented. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable "semantic units" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by exploring methods for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study. Formal notions of compositionality are discussed as well as a brief comparison with similar research tools. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract               = {Web Services (WS), which are based on standard XML protocols, such as, WSDL, SOAP and UDDI, are the building blocks of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The aim of SOA is to automate web service tasks, such as, web service discovery, selection, composition and execution. Since XML is a syntax-based language, the automation of these tasks is still a challenge. To overcome this, web services can be described semantically using an ontology description language, e.g., Web Ontology Language (OWL), giving rise to semantic web services (SWS). Because semantic web services are relatively new, there has been little research into testing and quality assurance aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating test cases based on user requirements for testing semantic web services. In SWS frameworks, such as, Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO), the user requirements are presented as a goal specification in terms of a state model. We use a model checking approach to generate test cases from this state model. To achieve this, we represent a set of rules for translation from a goal specification to a formal B abstract state machine. The B representation of the goal specification is given as input to the model checker to generate concrete test cases using the assertion violation property of the model checker. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated using a real world case study based on, the Amazon E-commerce Service. © 2009 IEEE.},

The central idea is to enable some low-level conflicts to be ignored by taking higher-level application semantics into account. In this paper, we approach the formal specification of a multi-level transaction scheduler using Abstract State Machines. We are particularly interested in showing that concrete protocols for multi-level transaction processing arise as refinements of an abstract ground model specification. Furthermore, we are interested in the proof of desirable properties of such schedulers such as the correctness and if possible also completeness with respect to serialisability, and the recoverability of the accepted schedules. For this we investigate a two-phase locking and a hybrid protocol. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

ASMs gained much attention as a specification method. It is extremely flexible because any mathematical structure may serve as a state. Gurevich characterized the expressive power of ASMs in terms of intuitively convincing postulates. The core result of this paper shows that the next-state function M of an Abstract State Machine M can be described on a symbolic level, notwithstanding the generality of the model: The successor state M (S) of a state S is fully specified by the equivalence ∼<inf>S</inf> induced by S on the terms over the signature of M. Consequently, M (S) is computable in case ∼<inf>S</inf> is decidable. Furthermore, this result implies a notion of computability for general structures, e.g. for algorithms operating on real numbers. © 2008.},

	abstract = {Pattern and routine activities theories suggest that through a combination of decisions and innate understandings of environmental cues, likely offenders are able to separate good criminal opportunities from bad risks. The nature of this process is highly structured and allows researchers to anticipate likely concentrations for a variety of regular, daily activities, including criminal offences. This chapter sets out to model and test these theoretical principles. Mastermind represents an interdisciplinary research project in computational criminology jointly managed by ICURS and the Software Technology Lab at Simon Fraser University. Using the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in combination with a multiagent based modeling paradigm, we devise a formal framework for semantic modeling and systematic integration of the theories for crime analysis and understanding crime patterns. We focus on crime in urban areas and model spatial and temporal aspects of crime potentially involving multiple offenders and multiple targets. Mastermind is used in a hypothetical analysis of motor vehicle theft. © 2008, IGI Global.},

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable semantic units that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study. © 2008 Springer Netherlands.},

It is straightforward to represent such an automaton as an Abstract State Machine (ASM). However, creating a whole VPA is not an efficient validation approach. In this paper it is shown, how the VPA construction can be avoided by using a refined ASM that only requires knowledge of the EDTD. In a second step this approach is extended to approximate validation of streaming XML documents taking at most k updates to the document into consideration. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

It provides flexibility for semantics description in two axes: on the one axis, operational semantics is fixed and one can choose between different description languages (QVT, Java, Prolog, Abstract State Machines, and Scheme); on the other axis, Scheme is fixed and one can choose between operational and translational semantics. Using operational semantics, DSL program interpretation can be animated and debugged. Equivalence of operational semantics described with different languages can be tested by comparing execution traces.},

In this paper, we propose the integration of two multiagent modeling paradigms, Abstract State Machines and Interpreted Systems, to develop a comprehensive framework for computational Situation Analysis (SA) as a basis for design and development of decision support systems. Due to the similarities of the underlying modeling concepts, a systematic integration of the two paradigms seems sensible, as each one has its particular focus and strength, complementing each other in several respects. Our approach builds on multiagent systems theories to formalize the distributed aspect, allows for reasoning about knowledge, uncertainty and belief change, and enables rapid prototyping of abstract executable decision support system models.},

  abstract               = {This paper presents an approach to model checking abstract state machines (ASMs) without the need for translation of the ASM specification into the modeling language of an existing model checker. Instead, our model checker [mc]square uses the simulation capabilities of CoreASM to build the state space, thereby directly supporting ASMs and circumventing a possible loss of expressiveness in a translation process. This enables our approach to present counterexamples and witnesses directly as sequences of ASM states and at the same time supports the major features of CoreASM like distributed ASMs, n-ary functions or extended rule forms. We show the applicability of this approach in a case study that also reveals possible improvements desirable for minimizing the duration needed for building the state space and its memory consumption. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract               = {We survey the use of the Abstract State Machines (ASM) method for a rigorous foundation of modeling and validating web services, workflows, interaction patterns and business processes. We show in particular that one can tailor business process definitions in application-domain yet rigorous terms in such a way that the resulting ASM models can be used as basis for binding contracts between domain experts and IT technologists. The method combines the expressive power and accuracy of rule-based modeling with the intuition provided by visual graph-based descriptions. We illustrate this by an ASM-based semantical framework for the OMG standard for BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The framework supports true concurrency, heterogeneous state and modularity (compositional design and verification techniques). As validation example we report some experiments, carried out with a special-purpose ASM simulator, to evaluate various definitions proposed in the literature for the critical OR-join construct of BPMN. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Since traditional data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph, they cannot be directly applied to ASMs. In this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph. Therefore, we revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. We also specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The rendezvous problem is unsolvable in the class of arbitrary connected graphs, as witnessed by the example of the cycle. Hence we restrict attention to rendezvous in trees, where rendezvous is feasible if and only if the initial positions of the agents are not symmetric. We prove that the minimum memory size guaranteeing rendezvous in all trees of size at most n is Θ(log n) bits. The upper bound is provided by an algorithm for abstract state machines accomplishing rendezvous in all trees, and using O(log n) bits of memory in trees of size at most n. The lower bound is a consequence of the need to distinguish between up to n∈-∈1 links incident to a node. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we focus on the potential existence of pairs of finite agents (i.e., finite automata) capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees. We show that, as opposed to what has been proved for the graph exploration problem, there are no finite agents capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We used this definition as the basis of the formal verification of the refinements of the Mondex case study with the interactive theorem prover KIV. The refinement definition we give differs from the one we gave in earlier work which preserves partial and total correctness assertions of ASM runs. The reason is that the main goal of the refinement of the Mondex protocol is to preserve a security invariant, while total correctness is not preserved. To preserve invariants, the definition of generalized forward simulation is limited to the use of "small" diagrams, which contain of a single protocol step. We show a technique that allows to use the natural "big" diagrams that consist of an atomic action being refined by a full protocol run. © J.UCS.},

  abstract               = {In this paper, we present the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language, which is a language for the specification of embedded real-time systems. In the engineering of embedded real-time systems, the correctness of the system is defined in terms of three aspects - function, time, and resource consumption. The goal of the TASM language and its associated toolset is to provide a basis for specification-based real-time system engineering where these three aspects can be specified and analyzed. The TASM language is built on top of Abstract State Machines (ASM) by including facilities for compact and legible specification of non-functional behavior, namely time and resource consumption. The TASMlanguage provides a notation which is well-suited to the specification needs of embedded real-time systems. We begin the presentation of the language with a historical survey on the use of ASM in specifying real-time systems. The core difference between the TASM language and ASM is that steps are inherently durative instead of being instantaneous and steps consume resources. These concepts capture the reality of physical systems in a flexible abstract model. We present the syntax and semantics of the language and illustrate the concepts using an extended version of the production cell case study. © J.UCS.},

We introduce the language AsmetaL used to write ASM specifications, and we provide the AsmetaL encoding of ASM specifications of increasing complexity.

As a case study, we analyze an existing Java/JVM compilation correctness proof for defining, interpreting, compiling, and executing bytecode for the Java language. We show how features modularize program source, theorem statements and their proofs. By composing features, the source code, theorem statements and proofs for a program are assembled. The investigation in this paper reveals a striking similarity of the refinement concepts used in Abstract State Machines (ASM) based system development and Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP) of software product lines.

This theorem presupposes three natural postulates about algorithmic computation. Here, we show that augmenting those postulates with an additional requirement regarding basic operations gives a natural axiomatization of computability and a proof of Church's Thesis, as Gödel and others suggested may be possible. In a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations, one can prove Turing's Thesis, characterizing the effective string functions, and - in particular - the effectively-computable functions on string representations of numbers. © 2008, Association for Symbolic Logic.},

  abstract               = {ASM refinements are verified using generalized forward simulations which allow to refine m abstract operations to n concrete operations with arbitrary m and n. One main difference to data refinement is that ASM refinement considers infinite runs and termination. Since backward simulation does not preserve termination in general, the standard technique of adding history information to the concrete level is not applicable. The powerset construction also adds infinite runs and is therefore not applicable too. This paper shows that a completeness proof is nevertheless possible by adding infinite prophecy information, effectively moving nondetermism to the initial state. Adding such prophecy information can be done on the semantic level, but also by a simple syntactic transformation that removes the choose construct of ASMs. The completeness proof is also ported to give a completeness proof for IO automata. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract            = {Several approaches to semantic Web services, including OWL-S, SWSF, and WSMO, have been proposed in the literature with the aim to enable automation of various tasks related to Web services, including discovery, contracting, enactment, monitoring, and mediation. The ability to specify processes and to reason about them is central to these initiatives. In this paper we analyze the WSMO choreography model, which is based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and propose a methodology for generating WSMO choreography from visual specifications. We point out the limitations of the current WSMO model and propose a faithful extension that is based on Concurrent Transaction Logic (CTR). The advantage of a CTR-based model is that it uniformly captures a number of aspects that previously required separate mechanisms or were not captured at all. These include process specification, contracting for services, service enactment, and reasoning. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract            = {Given a set of unquantified conditionals considered as default rules or a set of quantified conditionals such as probabilistic rules, an agent can build up its internal epistemic state from such a knowledge base by inductive reasoning techniques. Besides certain (logical) knowledge, epistemic states are supposed to allow the representation of preferences, beliefs, assumptions etc. of an intelligent agent. If the agent lives in a dynamic environment, it has to adapt its epistemic state constantly to changes in the surrounding world in order to be able to react adequately to new demands. In this paper, we present a high-level specification of the CONDOR system that provides powerful methods and tools for managing knowledge represented by conditionals and the corresponding epistemic states of an agent. Thereby, we are able to elaborate and formalize crucial interdependencies between different aspects of knowledge representation, knowledge discovery, and belief revision. Moreover, this specification, using Gurevich's Abstract State Machines, provides the basis for a stepwise refinement development process of the CONDOR system based on the ASM methodology. © 2008 Universitatsbibliothek TU Berlin.},

The operating of databases has been based in the past on temporal logics and did not yet get an easy to understand formal underpinning. Therefore, conceptions like transaction and recovery are mainly discussed at the logical or operational level. This paper shows that database structuring and functionality can be defined within a uniform language. We base database semantical on the operational semantics of abstract state machines (ASM). This uniform mechanism allows to define the structuring, the functionality, the distribution and the interactivity of a database system in a way that supports abstract consideration at various layers of abstraction, that supports refinement of specifications to more detailed ones and that support proof of properties. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.},

While the precise definition of service foundations including an appropriate general service model is still an open research issue, event and process algebras, petri nets, and abstract state machines (ASMs) are commonly considered as suitable candidates for developing such a formal model. In this paper, we consider how a basic ASM-based serviceoriented architecture (SOA) model can be refined in different ways to capture fundamental properties of the three most common SOA approaches: ESB-style Web, REST-like Web, and IMS-based telecommunication services. © 2008 IEEE.},

Therefore a large number of services can be composed to provide meaningful results to complex geospatial queries, but as the complexity grows, the users face serious performance problems. On top of existing geospatial web services we adopt the WSMO/L/X framework which provides a model to define machine and human-understandable semantic descriptions, full support for mediation and a simple language to choreograph the execution of a composition of several geospatial web services. Our research focus is on the semantic execution and its performance inside the WSMX platform. Our core contributions are: (1) providing a solution for automated semantic execution of geospatial queries; and (2) providing a combination of techniques and improvements to the efficiency aspect. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The extensions lead to a typed version of ASMs and a more specific notion of strong data refinement, which incorporates the preservation of information content by means of schema dominance. Each typed ASM can be effectively translated into an equivalent ordinary one. Providing typed ASMs helps to exploit the existing logical formalisms used in data-intensive applications to define a ground model. Furthermore, strong data refinement helps to set up a refinement-based development method that uses provably correct standard refinement rules. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.},

In this paper we report on two results. First, on the successful verification of the full case study using the KIV specification and verification system. We demonstrate that even though the hand-made proofs were elaborated to an enormous level of detail we still could find small errors in the underlying data refinement theory, as well as the formal proofs of the case study. Second, the original Mondex case study verifies functional correctness assuming a suitable security protocol. We extend the case study here with a refinement to a suitable security protocol that uses symmetric cryptography to achieve the necessary properties of the security-relevant messages. The definition is based on a generic framework for defining such protocols based on abstract state machines (ASMs). We prove the refinement using a forward simulation. © 2007 British Computer Society.},

  abstract               = {Today's Web applications require instruments and techniques able to face their complexity which has noticeably increased at the expense of productivity and quality factors. A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the "everything is a model" principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or WebML. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {Domain-specific modeling has growing importance in many fields of software enginering, such as modeling control flows of data processing, or in man-machine systems. Customizable language dictionary and customizable notations of the model elements offered by domain-specific technologies make software systems easier to create and maintain. However, visual model definitions have a tendency to be incomplete, or imprecise; the definitions can be extended by textual constraints attached to the model items. Textual constraints can eliminate the incompleteness stemming from the limitations of the structural definition as well. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is one of the most popular constraint languages in the field of UML and Domain Specific Modeling Languages. OCL is a flexible, yet formal language with a mathematical background. Existing formalisms of OCL does not describe dynamic behavior of constraints. Our research aims at creating an OCL optimization solution and prove its correctness formally. However, the shortcomings of the existing formalism has led us to create a new formalism. The paper presents OCLASM, a new formalism for OCL, which can describe both the semantics and the dynamical behavior of the language constructs, thus, it is capable of describing proofs of optimization algortihms. OCLASM is based on the Abstract State Machines technique.},

  abstract               = {On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems deal with analytical tasks in businesses. As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data used in OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. Typical OLAP queries are data intensive, and thus time consuming. In order to speed up the query computation, it is a common practice to materialize some of the computations as views based on a set of queries given. In general we wish to optimize query time under a given maintenance constraints. However, OLAP queries are not static and may change over time. Thus designing data warehouse is an ongoing task. This process is also called dynamic or incremental design. In this paper, we approach this issue as a refinement step in our Abstract State Machine (ASM) based data warehouse design, and support it by a set of standard refinement rules.

  abstract               = {To specify, design, and implement complex system-on-chip (SoC), a new modeling method, transaction level modeling (TLM), has been proposed recently. TLM allows designers to focus on functionality while abstracting implementation details. At the register transfer level (RTL), however, different modules communicate through detailed pin level signaling. SoC design methodologies involve the integration of different intellectual property (IP) blocks modeled at different levels of abstraction. Therefore a special module or channel is needed in order to link modules, IPs, designed at different abstraction levels. This module, called transactor, can be modeled using a finite state machine (FSM) providing a functional specification of the protocol's behavior. In this paper, we propose a methodology to specify transactors using graphical finite state machine (FSM). This technique enables an automatic generation of SystemC TLM-RTL transactors via an intermediate translation of the user-defined FSM to the Abstract State Machines Language (AsmL). The UTOPIA standard protocol is provided as an illustration of this approach. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Finite state machine-derived specifications such as X-Machines, Extended Finite State Machines and Abstract State Machines, are an established means to model software behaviour. They allow for comprehensive testing of an implementation in terms of its intended behaviour. In practice however they are rarely generated and maintained during software development, hence their benefits can rarely be exploited. We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives. The technique has been implemented, which has enabled us to present a small case study of its use with respect to a real software system, along with some preliminary performance results.},

  abstract               = {We ease the design of collaborative business processes respecting desired business goals by the composition algorithm presented in this paper. The composition of multiple parties ' business processes is always done with a specific objective in mind. Not only in the positive case, but also if the objective of a business process can not be fulfilled, all participating business processes need to be in some expected recovery state. We propose a composition algorithm solving the task of designing a collaborative business process while respecting a set of primary and recovery goals. In our model, each business process is described as a finite state machine. The multiplication of all business processes in one single model of possible executions would lead to an explosion of the number of states. Therefore, our composition algorithm directly interprets the multiple finite state machine (FSM) representations and creates a collaborative business process without integrating all FSMs into a single FSM upfront. Our composition algorithm returns an orchestration of the given business processes only in the case that it can be assured that each execution only leads to an expected primary or recovery goal. In order to prove our concepts, we first mathematically define the execution of business processes and orchestrations by providing abstract state machine (ASM) representations for them. Second, we execute the ASMs in the execution engine CoreASM which shows that the generated orchestration steers the execution of the business processes as intended. © 2007 IEEE.},

We provide a complete embedding of PSL in the ASM language AsmL, which allows us to integrate PSL properties as a part of the design. For verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the code containing both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage of the AsmL language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both C# code and FSMs from AsmL models. We applied our approach on the PCI-X bus standard, which AsmL model was constructed from the informal standard specifications and a subsequent UML model. Experimental results on the PCI-X bus case study showed a superiority of our approach to conventional verification. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable "semantic units" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study. © 2007 EDAA.},

  abstract               = {Symbolic Trajectory Evaluation (STE) is a symbolic simulation based bounded model checking approach and its computational complexity depends only on the property being checked not on the size of the circuit. In this paper, we study First-order Symbolic Trajectory Evaluation (FSTE). We first present the computation model: Abstract State Machines (ASMs) combined with a partial order over the state space, in which data and data operations are described using abstract sort and uninterpreted function symbols. Second, we devise an FSTE algorithm which is based on implicit state enumeration of an ASM and implemented using Multiway Decision Graphs (MDGs). Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There exist a number of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that detect computer attacks based on some defined attack scenarios. The attack scenarios or security requirements in some of these IDSs are specified in attack specification languages that are different from software specification languages. The use of two different languages for software specification and attack specification may generate redundant and conflicting requirements. The advantage of using the same language for both functional specifications and attacks specifications is that software designers can address the two different issues without learning two types of languages. We present a method of integrating Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) state charts that are extended finite state machine based software specification languages, with an open source IDS Snort. This work provides AsmL and UML users an IDS that they can use without knowing how to write Snort rules. We automatically translate attack scenarios written in AsmL and UML state charts into Snort rules with context information. The original Snort is modified so that it can use the rules automatically generated by the translator. Adding context information to Snort rules improves the detection capability of Snort. To show the efficacy of the presented approach, we have built a prototype and evaluated it using a number of well-known attack scenarios. © Springer-Verlag 2007.},

Custom algorithms to verify these properties automatically have been devised for a number of specification languages, including SCR, RSML, and Statecharts. In this paper, we provide means to automatically verify completeness and consistency of Abstract State Machine (ASM) specifications. The verification is performed using a widely available tool, a SAT solver. The use of a SAT solver removes the need for designing and fine tuning language specific verification algorithms. Furthermore, the use of a SAT solver automates the verification procedure and produces a counterexample automatically when a specification is incomplete or inconsistent. We provide an algorithm to translate ASM specifications to a SAT problem instance. The translation is illustrated using the TASM toolset in conjunction with the "production cell system" case study. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract State Machines (ASMs) provide a mathematical framework for system modelling, while Model Checking is a technology for verification of system properties. Together, they form a powerful tool for checking systems. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a competitive model checking approach due to its ability to compactly encode BMC problems. In this paper, we present a method of applying ASP to BMC of ASMs. Given an ASM and a temporal property, we show how to efficiently translate the BMC problem for the ASM into a problem of answer set computation. Experimental results for our method using the answer set solvers SMODELS and CMODELS are also given.},

Manual test writing or automated random test generation techniques are often used for such validation practices. However, directing tests to particular reachable states of a SystemC model is often difficult, especially when these models are large and complex. In this work, we present a model-driven methodology for generating directed tests that take the SystemC model under validation to specific reachable states. This allows the validation to uncover very specific scenarios which lead to different corner cases. Our formal modeling is done entirely within the Microsoft SpecExplorer tool to describe the specification of the system under validation in the notation of AsmL. We also exploit SpecExplorer's abilities for state space exploration for our test generations, and its APIs for connecting the model to implementation programs to drive the validation of SystemC models with the generated test cases.

There are ways to extend the abstract state machine (ASM) framework with distribution aspects, but there is no unifying framework for handling time so far. We propose event structures extended with time as a natural framework for representing state machines and their true concurrency model at a semantic level and for discussing associated time models. Constraints on these timed event structures and their traces (runs) are then used for characterising different frameworks for timed computations. This characterisation of timed frameworks is independent of ASM and allows to compare time models of different modelling formalisms. Finally, we propose some specific extensions of ASM for the expressions of time constraints in accordance with the event-based semantic framework and show the applicability of the obtained framework on an example with a standard time model and a set of consistency properties for timed computations.},

Vision of a Grand Challenge project. In: [Meyer05]) to gain practical impact, one needs to include rigorous definitions and analysis, prior to code development and comprising both experimental validation and mathematical verification, of ground models, i.e., blueprints that describe the required application-content of programs. This implies the need to link via successive refinements the relevant properties of such high-level models in a traceable and checkable way to code a compiler can verify. We outline the Abstract State Machines (ASM) method, a discipline for reliable system development which allows one to bridge the gap between informal requirements and executable code by combining application-centric experimentally validatable system modelling with mathematically verifiable stepwise detailing of abstract models to compile-time-verifiable code. © British Computer Society 2007.},

  abstract            = {We ease the design of collaborative business processes respecting desired business goals by the composition algorithm presented in this paper. The composition of multiple parties’ business processes is always done with a specific objective in mind. Not only in the positive case, but also if the objective of a business process can not be fulfilled, all participating business processes need to be in some expected recovery state. We propose a composition algorithm solving the task of designing a collaborative business process while respecting a set of primary and recovery goals. In our model, each business process is described as a finite state machine. The multiplication of all business processes in one single model of possible executions would lead to an explosion of the number of states. Therefore, our composition algorithm directly interprets the multiple finite state machine (FSM) representations and creates a collaborative business process without integrating all FSMs into one single FSM upfront. Our composition algorithm returns an orchestration of the given business processes only in the case that it can be assured that each execution only leads to an expected primary or recovery goal. In order to prove our concepts, we first mathematically define the execution of business processes and orchestrations by providing abstract state machine (ASM) representations for them. Second, we execute the ASMs in the execution engine CoreASM which shows that the generated orchestration steers the execution of the business processes as intended. © 2007 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

A network-infrastructure grid, consisting of network entities, is one such approach. Such a grid harnesses the idle compute power in the network, and offers transparent network services to end-users. This paper emphasizes the need for autonomy in such grids. Among the autonomous features, certain services have been found to be necessary and some others, desirable. These are discussed using our network-layer grid, namely the iSEGrid. Techniques to customize these features to application requirements are provided. An important contribution made in this paper is a formal framework, based on Abstract State Machines, for specifying, defining an autonomous network layer grid. © 2007 IEEE.},

Nevertheless, fighting for appropriate programming and specification languages has not yet come to an end: The Java-programming language and the Abstract State Machines ASM are new and representative specimens which have arisen recently. These languages are even advancing and improving themselves: Original Java 1996, a flat language language without class nestings, towards more modern Java 2000 with nested classes, and Basic ASM resp. Evolving Algebras 1988/91 towards Turbo ASM 2003 where machines and rules show new features like naming, parameterizing, local states and recursive calls. These transitions inside Java resp. ASM remind at a much earlier transition from Fortran and Algol 58 to Algol 60 with its block concept and nested, parameterized, recursive and formal procedures. Aim of the present essay is to show that many of those new concepts incorporated in new Java and Turbo ASM were already available in Algo160. © Springer-Verlage Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

The TASM language enables the specification of functional and non-functional properties using a unified language. The toolset incorporates features to create specifications, simulate specifications, and verify formal properties of specifications. Properties that can be verified using the toolset include completeness, consistency, worst-case execution time, and best-case execution time. The toolset is being developed as part of an architecture-based framework for embedded realtime system engineering.

We show that providing typed ASMs helps to exploit the existing logical formalisms used in data-intensive areas to define a ground model and refinement rules. We also note that the extensions do not increase the expressiveness of ASMs, as each typed ASM will be equivalent to an "ordinary" one. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

In the mid 80ies Gurevich proposed Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as a computation model that regards algebras as dynamic: a state of an ASM is represented by a freely chosen algebra which may change during a computation. In [8] Gurevich characterizes the class of sequential ASMs in a purely semantic way by five amazingly general and elegant axioms. In [9] this result is extended to boundednondeterministic ASMs. This paper considers the general case of unbounded-nondeterministic ASMs: in each step, an unbounded-nondeterministic ASM may choose among unboundedly many (sometimes infinitely many) alternatives. We characterize the class of unbounded-nondeterministic ASMs by an extension of Gurevich's original axioms for sequential ASMs. We apply this result to prove the reversibility of unbounded-nondeterministic ASMs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Using semantics, it is investigated a formal approach to program transformation and optimization. Usually, the result code of source code by a compiler is not necessary the best one, and can be improved to run faster or to use less memory. This kind of improvement is done in compiling phase after parsing. Some good techniques in optimization are in folding the constants, elimination of dead code, or improvement of the loops. Here it is considered the runtime overhead and present how can this be improved. The source is specific for object oriented languages with late binding, where a name of method to be called is bound to method dynamically. It increases the computation time by a cost of traversing the class hierarchy each time a method is called. It is than proved that the transformed program to its optimized version it is equivalent to original the program.},

The main part of this article describes the structure of the protocol ASM and all its relevant parts. Our modeling technique enables an attacker model exactly tailored to the application, instead of only an attacker similar to the Dolev-Yao model. We also introduce a proof technique for security properties of the protocols. Properties are proved in the KIV system using symbolic execution and invariants. Furthermore we describe a graphical notation based on UML diagrams that allows to specify the important parts of the application in a simple way. Our formal approach is exemplified with a small e-commerce application. We use an electronic wallet to demonstrate the ASM-based protocol model and we also show what the proof obligations of some of the security properties look like. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {Moore's Law continues to drive a severe increase in the number of transistors that can be integrated onto a single microprocessor chip. Computer architects and designers continue to look for ways to take advantage from it to produce ever more complex microprocessors. Meanwhile, market forces are dictating a shorter time to market, a proliferation of product and steeper volume ramps in production. However, it is evident that logic correctness is one of the main challenges that computer engineers usually face during the design and validation of such systems. In the last 20 years, researchers and industrial experts invented several modeling and validation technologies, such as logic simulation, fast hardware emulation engines, and formal methods. However the design size and complexity continue to grow and outstrip what the validation techniques can do for producing high quality and correct systems. As a results, the validation problem is becoming more complex to solve and is indeed the main limiter for producing a high quality silicon products. Design abstraction and high level modeling is a fundamental design strategy to cope with system complexity. The basic idea is to hide design implementation details, while focusing on design specification, capturing the pure logic properties and behaviors of the system. Doing this, we believe that the size of the design model can be dramatically decreased because none functional or physical properties of the design are excluded. Therefore the design representation is purely logical and have a clear semantics which it becomes easier to understand, easier and faster to validate using dynamic or formal techniques, so design errors can be detected earlier before going into detailed implementation and thus avoid a costly design iterations due to late soundness issues. In this talk we will present abstract modeling techniques and their verification challenges. In particular we will describe the Abstract State Machines approach for modeling and verification of high level models. In addition we will outline several research topics in this domain to encourage the academic community to take an active part in exploring and developing new verification methods that can cope with the increasing complexity of microprocessors' design. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

In real-time systems, quantitative values of time, as reflected through the duration of actions, are central to the system's correctness. We review basic time concepts and explain how time is handled in different modeling languages. We expose the inherent paradox of incorporating quantitative time-dependent behavior in high-level models. High-level models are typically built before the system is implemented, which makes quantitative time metrics difficult to predict since these metrics depend heavily on implementation details. We provide some possible answers to this paradox and explain how the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language helps address some of these issues. © 2007 IEEE.},

Therefore, the software remains vulnerable to attacks which are handled by issuing patches or service packs by the software vendors. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to take security into consideration right from the very beginning of the software development process. However, most specification languages were not designed with an intention for specifying security requirements, and therefore, they lack some features to serve this purpose. As a result, we need suitable specification languages that can be used both for functional specification and security specification. We propose a formal extension of a popular specification language called AsmL (Abstract State Machine Language) for attack descriptions with a view to building secure software. We name the extended language AsmLSec. We present the details of AsmLSec syntax and semantics, describe how to model attacks using its constructs, and present the design and implementation of a compiler that generates attack signatures from the AsmLSec attack specifications. To evaluate the expressive power of AsmLSec, we model attack scenarios based on the benchmark DARPA data sets. ©2007 IEEE.},

The basic ingredients of this strategy are a visual programming interface with an appropriate abstract state machine, which has to be realized by distributed virtual machines. The distributed virtual machines must be scalable, have to allow parallel processing, have to be fault-tolerant, and should have the potential to work in real time. The objects, which have to be processed by these virtual machines, are logical models (LModels), which represent dynamic knowledge, including self-learning systems.

MIC places strong emphasis on the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and model transformations in design flows. Building on our earlier work on transformational specification of semantics for DSMLs, the paper proposes a «semantic unit» - a common semantic model - for timed automata behavior. The semantic unit is defined using Abstract State Machine (ASM) formalism. We show that the precise semantics of a wide range of timed automata based modeling languages (TAMLs) can be defined through specifying model transformations between a domain-specific TAML and the semantic unit. The proposed method that we call semantic anchoring is demonstrated by developing the transformation rules from the UPPAAL and IF languages to the semantic unit. © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Enterprise modeling involves multiple domains of expertise: requirements engineering, business process modeling, IT development etc. Our experience has shown that hierarchical enterprise models, made of an assembly of system models, are effective. In these models, two hierarchies exist: an organizational level hierarchy (describing systems' construction) and a functional level hierarchy (describing systems' functionality). Using a uniform hierarchical modeling language, system models at different hierarchical levels can be aligned in the context of the enterprise model. Using an operational semantics, each system model can be translated into executable code for model simulation and testing. The possibility to simulate and test models leads to the alignment verification for all system models across both hierarchies. In this paper we propose a method and tool for functional alignment verification. We use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) and the ASM language (AsmL) to formalize our graphical models for simulation and testing. We illustrate this approach with an example.},

This paper presents a proposition of a hybrid approach to the specification, analysis and testing of grid middleware using ASM. This approach allows an easy integration of created specification of developed middleware with existing components of grid systems. The important advantage of this approach is an automatic generation of test procedures for the implementation, following the model-based testing approach. This allows a smooth transition from the specification to implementation stage, as well as investigation of features of specification and implementation, at every stage of their development. Also, we propose a software environment which implements the proposed approach. Its use in practice will help to create more reliable grid systems. © 2006 IEEE.},

For the verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the ASM code (containing both the design and the properties) into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage from the ASM language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both a C# code and an FSM representation from an ASM model. We applied our approach on SystemC designs, which are translated into ASM models. Experimental results on a bus structure from the SystemC library showed a superiority of our approach to conventional verification. © 2006 IEEE.},

The central idea is that - once relevant information pieces of digital documents are modeled - desired migration results can be specified by means of preservation constraints. From these constraint specifications we are able to derive migration algorithms that provably respect a set of document properties before (pre-conditions) and after migration (post-conditions). Underlying is the concept of Abstract State Machines (ASM) modeling archival states. Migrations are modeled as sequences of basic operations that change the archive's state while respecting user-defined constraints. Among others, our target scenarios comprise legal and medical documents where considerable property changes cannot be tolerated and where constraint pre-servation must hold over a long period of time.

In this paper, we propose to generate Finite State Machines (FSM) from SystemC designs using two algorithms originally proponed for the generation of FSM from Abstract State Machines (ASM). This proposal enables the integration of SystemC with existing tools for test case generation from FSM. Hence, enabling two important applications: (1) using the FSM graph structure to produce test suites allowing functional testing of SystemC designs; and (2) performing conformance testing, where the FSM serves as a precise model of the observable behavior of the system used to validate lower abstraction levels of the design (e.g., Register Transfer Level (RTL)).},

These techniques are significant for design, reasoning and standardization of programming languages, and for design and optimization of compiler as well. They have been widely used in formal description, analysis, verification and design of security protocols. In sharp contrast to the popularity of formal syntax, formal semantic descriptions have seldom been exploited in practical applications concerning design and implementation of programming languages. In this paper, we firstly review the history of development for semantic description frameworks of programming languages. Then we illustrate and assess the features of main frameworks of current interest. Finally, we give the qualitative comparisons of these frameworks distinctly. We conclude that the abstract state machine (ASM) and modular monadic action semantics (MMAS) approaches are two good candidates for such a framework.},

	abstract = {There exist a number of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that detect computer attacks based on some defined attack scenarios. The attack scenarios or security requirements in some of these IDSs are specified in attack specification languages which are separate from software specification languages. The use of two different languages for software specification and attack specification may generate redundant and conflicting requirements. The advantage of using the same language for both functional specifications and attacks specifications is that software designers can address the two different issues without learning the two types of languages. We present a method of using a software specification language called Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) as an attack specification language for the open source IDS Snort. This work provides AsmL users an IDS that they can use without knowing how to write Snort rules. We automatically translate attack scenarios written in AsmL into Snort rules with context information. The original Snort is modified so that it can use the rules automatically generated by the translator. Adding context information to Snort rules improves the detection capability of Snort. To show the efficacy of our presented approach, we have built a prototype and evaluated it using a number of well-known attack scenarios. © 2006 ACM.},

In the present work, we describe, by means of suitable postulates, those interactive algorithms that (1) proceed in discrete, global steps; (2) perform only a bounded amount of work in each step; (3) use only such information from the environment as can be regarded as answers to queries; and (4) never complete a step until all queries from that step have been answered. We indicate how a great many sorts of interaction meet these requirements. We also discuss in detail the structure of queries and replies and the appropriate definition of equivalence of algorithms. Finally, motivated by our considerations concerning queries, we discuss a generalization of first-order logic in which the arguments of function and relation symbols are not merely tuples of elements but orbits of such tuples under groups of permutations of the argument places. © 2006 ACM.},

As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data used in OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to dialogue interfaces for OLAP. Data Warehouses and OLAP systems are a promising area for the application of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this article a layered ground model specification for data warehouses and OLAP system is presented that is based explicitly on the fundamental idea of separating input from operational databases from output to OLAP systems. On this basis we start defining formal refinement rules for such systems. As these refinement rules are formally correct they enable a formal method for the high-quality design of data warehouses and OLAP systems that can be applied without knowing mathematical details of the ASM formalism. Furthermore, we discuss pragmatic guidelines for the application of such rules. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The answer given here explores the abstract state ma- chine (ASM) paradigm: A versatile semantic framework for computational modeling of virtually all kinds of discrete dynamic systems. Combining common abstraction principles from computational logic and discrete mathematics, abstract state machines provide a universal model of computation and an effective instrument for analyzing and reasoning about complex semantic properties of real-world systems. In this paper we introduce a novel ASM tool environment for making ASM ground models executable on real machines. We present the CoreASM language and the general architecture of the CoreASM engine together with a highlevel description of its extensibility mechanisms.},

In some cases, the DSMLs are based on a formalism that has many implementation variants, such as Statecharts. For instance, it could be necessary to transform iLogix Statechart models into Matlab Stateflow models. The preservation of behavior of the models is crucial in such transformations. Bisimulation has previously been demonstrated as an approach to verifying behavior preservation, and semantic anchoring is an approach to specifying the dynamic semantics of DSMLs. We propose a method to verify behavior preservation, using bisimulation in conjunction with semantic anchoring. We will consider two hypothetical variants of the Statecharts formalism, and specify the operational semantics of each variant by semantic anchoring, using Abstract State Machines as a common semantic framework. We then establish bisimulation properties to verify if the behavior models of the source and target Statechart models are equivalent for a particular execution of the transformation. © 2006 Universitatsbibliothek TU Berlin.},

	abstract = {Recent advancement in hardware design urged using a transaction based model as a new intermediate design level. Supporters for the Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) trend claim its efficiency in terms of rapid prototyping and fast simulation in comparison to the classical RTL-based approach. Intuitively, from a verification point of view, faster simulation induces better coverage results. This is driven by two factors: coverage measurement and simulation guidance. In this paper, we propose to use an abstract model, of the design, written in the Abstract State Machines Language (AsmL), in order to provide an adequate way for measuring the functional coverage. Then, we use this metric in defining the fitness function of a genetic algorithm proposed to improve the simulation efficiency. Finally, we compare our coverage and simulation results to: (1) random simulation at TLM; and (2) the Specman tool of Verisity at RTL.},

	abstract = {In many safety-critical applications of embedded systems, the system dynamics exhibits hybrid behaviors. To enable automatic analysis of these embedded systems, many analysis tools have been developed based on hybrid automata model. These tools are constructed by their own domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) but they are different in various aspects. To enable meaningful semantic interpretation of DSMLs, we propose an infrastructure for semantic anchoring that facilitates the transformational specification of DSML semantics. In the semantic anchoring infrastructure, the semantics of a DSML can be anchored to a well-defined semantic unit, which captures the operational semantics of hybrid automaton, via model transformation. The Abstract State Machine (ASM) is used as the underlying formal framework for the semantic unit. The semantics of a DSML is defined by specifying the transformation between the abstract syntax metamodel of the DSML and that of the semantic unit. The infrastructure can also enable model exchange among DSMLs while referring to the common semantic unit. Hence, hybrid automata based DSMLs can be integrated to form a meaningful tool chain by deploying this proposed infrastructure. In this paper, we demonstrate how effective the tool-chain infrastructure is by considering a practical case study involving the hybrid automata DSMLs, HyVisual and ReachLab. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Many design methodologies have been proposed to cope with the technical intricacy of such systems. Although each of them proposes its own constructs, they share a common metamodel enabling the designer to describe Web applications under three different views: data, navigation and presentation. While the constructs can be unified in such a metamodel, consistency among the views is guaranteed by less formal relations being essentially based on name conventions and/or ad-hoc tool support. This paper proposes explicit weaving models to define rigorous connections between the different artifacts produced during a system development, in order to enhance their reuse and maintenance and perform operations based on the connection semantics. These structural mappings do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side, achieving a clear separation of views and their connections and enabling the use of general purpose theories and tools.

Several transaction protocols have been suggested for the transaction management, but they are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity interrupts message exchanges among BPMSs which use different transaction protocols, so that the interoperability among the BPMSs cannot be guaranteed. To solve this problem, this paper suggests a semantics-based protocol for business process transactions. The suggested protocol is composed of the static semantics and the operational semantics. In the context of the static semantics, transaction states and messages are defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In the context of the operational semantics, state transitions of business process transactions are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM). The suggested approach is expected to enhance interoperability among heterogeneous BPMSs, to increase the understandability for the transaction protocols, and to support automatic transaction execution and systematic transaction monitoring. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

This paper reports on the successful verification of the major part of the case study using the KIV specification and verification system. We demonstrate that even though the hand-made proofs were elaborated to an enormous level of detail, we still could find small errors in the underlying data refinement theory as well as the formal proofs of the case study. We also provide an alternative formalisation of the communication protocol using abstract state machines. Finally the Mondex case study verifies functional correctness assuming a suitable security protocol. Therefore we propose to extend the case study to include the verification of a suitable security protocol. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

	abstract = {Transaction-level modeling allows exploring several SoC design architectures, leading to better performance and easier verification of the final product. In this paper, we present an approach to design and verify SystemC models at the transaction level. We integrate the verification as part of the design flow where we first model both the design and the properties (written in Property Specification language) in Unifed Modeling Language (UML); then, we translate them into an intermediate format modeled with AsmL [language based on Abstract State Machines (ASM)]. The AsmL model is used to generate a finite state machine of the design, including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on the fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be reused to validate the design at lower levels by simulation. For existing SystemC designs, we propose to translate the code back to AsmL in order to apply the same verification approach. At the SystemC level, we also present a genetic algorithm to enhance the assertions coverage. We will ensure the soundness of our approach by proving the correctness of the SystemC-to-AsmL and AsmL-to-SystemC transformations. We illustrate our approach on two case studies including the PCI bus standard and a master/slave generic architecture from the SystemC library. © 2006 IEEE.},

The UML metamodel consists of informal description, class diagrams which are used to give the abstract syntax, and the well-formedness rules given in OCL. Furthermore, class diagrams have played an important role in software development because they provide basic information about a software system. In this paper, we propose a new method to support class diagrams based on Abstract State Machines. As an application of this method we will use a class diagram to represent OCL structure and therefore an OCL translator is generated. Based on the support of class diagrams and OCL, any user-defined UML model (M1-level), as an instantiation of the UML metamodel, can be compared against the UML metamodel. On the other hand, an object model (M0-level) can be checked based on the user-defined UML model (M1-level). Therefore, more errors can be reported to software developers during the early phase of software development.},

  abstract               = {Abstract State Machines (ASMs) encourage high-level system specifications without forcing the development into the "formal methods straightjacket". This makes them an ideal formal method for applications in areas, where otherwise only semi-formal methods are used. One such area is the development of data warehouse and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) applications to which this article contributes. Based on an ASM ground model for data warehouses we show which problems have to be solved in the case of distribution. This mainly amounts to making decisions on materialised views. In this article we develop simple refinement rules for this purpose. Then we develop a cost model that combines the costs of query processing with the maintenance costs arising from redundancy in the local data warehouse fragments. This cost model indicates, whether it is advantageous to apply a refinement rule or not. However, as the refinement process is non-deterministic, there is no guarantee that a global cost optimum will be reached. Copyright © 2005, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

We considered as illustrative case a Packet Switch model part of the SystemC library. We propose a verification methodology composed of two steps: (1) static code analysis using abstract interpretation; and (2) model checking. This latter is performed thanks to an integration of both the Property Specification Language (PSL) and the SystemC semantics in the Abstract States Machines (ASMs). We propose a technique based on a reachability algorithm part of the AsmL tool that translates the ASM code combining both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage from the ASM language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both a C# code and an FSM representation from an ASM model. The experimental results illustrate, in particular, a comer-case bug that we were able to detect in the design under verification.},

The ways to reach the autonomy are described - high reliability and adaptability of the system, reached by application of Al elements, formal structural models (specification, verification and real time control) and dynamic reconfiguration [1,2,4,9,10,11]. A method using trace models in real time for testing of system operations is described The method is suitable for systems specified by process algebras (CSP - Communicating Sequential Processes [3], Timed CSP [6], ASM - Abstract State Machine [5], and TAM - Temporal Agent Model [7]) where process traces are used The computing processes and these in the hardware are observed. Special control processes (tracers) are specified. They allow to control in real time the correspondence of the real system traces and preliminary computed traces (the formal specification) and send messages to the other subsystems when no correspondence (e.g. to specification and dynamic reconfiguration subsystems). The method allows finding In real time the software and hardware incorrectly functioning (disparity of the traces) based on rigorous mathematical specification. In the paper are described: an autonomous control system structural model, an algorithm for real time traces control, software simulations (laboratory models) of autonomous systems, the faults and reaction of the tracer-processes, all based on CPPCSP - C++ Communicating Sequential Processes library [8]. The application of trace models in real time allows find any system incorrectly operating and this is one of the ways for increasing the onboard computer systems' reliability and to achieve full operation autonomy. © 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Despite the fact that several integrated development methods for web information systems (WISs) have been proposed, quality assurance for such systems has hardly been addressed. In this paper some quality criteria are postulated and investigated by combining semi-formal and formal methods. On a high level of abstractions WISs can be described by abstract locations and transitions between them. These so-called story spaces can be formalised using Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which permit to verify, whether user-tailored versions are compatible with user preferences. Furthermore, ASMs provide a framework for refinement, which permits the integration of story spaces with extended views on databases. This leads to further proof obligations for consistency that can be formalised in the logic associated with ASMs.},

	abstract = {To protect software against malicious activities, organizations are required to monitor security breaches. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are those kinds of monitoring tools that have gained a considerable amount of popularity. A number of specification-based IDSs have been proposed, where security requirements or attack scenarios are specified using some languages. Currently, attack specification languages are being deployed for describing security requirements. Use of two different languages for software specification and security specification invites a number of unwanted but complicated issues, such as duplication of requirements specification effort as well as the existence of redundant and conflicting requirements. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection technique that uses a formal software specification language called Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) for the specification of security requirements. We present a framework, and develop the algorithm for the IDS that interprets the AsmL attack scenario specifications in order to detect intrusions. Moreover, we discuss case studies where the presented intrusion detection system is used to detect attacks. © 2005 IEEE.},

PCI-X, is the latest extension of the PCI local bus that is designed to meet increased I/O demands of recent technologies. The actual specification of PCI-X, provided by the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG), is informal (in natural English). Hence, it is prone to inherent problems of incompleteness, inconsistency and ambiguity. In our approach, we first model the bus in UML and then map it to AsmL. This AsmL model can be executed using the Asmlt tool that can generate the Finite State Machine (FSM) of the model. Such FSM can be of great use for verification purposes. © 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Self-Stabilization is an elegant approach for designing fault tolerant systems. A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of (self-stabilizing) infrastructure for their execution such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this work, we present a design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler designed for programs written in a language similar to the abstract state machine (ASM). The compiler preserves the stabilization property of the high level program. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Atomicity (or linearizability) is a commonly used consistency criterion for distributed services and objects. Although atomic object implementations are abundant, proving that algorithms achieve atomicity has turned out to be a challenging problem. In this paper, we initiate the study of systematic ways of verifying distributed implementations of atomic objects, beginning with read/write objects (registers). Our general approach is to replace the existing operational reasoning about events and partial orders with assertional reasoning about invariants and simulation relations. To this end, we define an abstract state machine that captures the atomicity property and prove correctness of the object implementations by establishing a simulation mapping between the implementation and the specification automata. We demonstrate the generality of our specification by showing that it is implemented by three different read/write register constructions: the message-passing register emulation of Attiya, Bar-Noy and Dolev, its optimized version based on real time, and the shared memory register construction of Vitanyi and Awerbuch. In addition, we show that a simplified version of our specification is implemented by a general atomic object construction based on the Lamport's replicated state machine algorithm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

Use Case Maps (UCM) is being standardized as part of the User Requirements Notation (URN), the most recent addition to ITU-T's family of languages. UCM models allow the description of functional requirements and high-level designs at early stages of the development process. Recognizing the importance of having a well defined semantic, we propose, in this paper, a concise and rigorous formal semantics for Use Case Maps (UCM). The proposed formal semantics addresses UCM's operational semantics and covers the key language functional constructs. These semantics are defined in terms of Multi-Agent Abstract State Machines that describes how UCM specifications are executed and eliminates ambiguities hidden in the informal language definition. The resulting operational semantics are embedded in an ASM-UCM simulation engine and are expressed in AsmL, an advanced ASM-based executable specification language. The proposed ASM-UCM engine provides an environment for executing and simulating UCM specifications. We illustrate our approach using an example of a simplified call connection. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2005.},

	abstract = {Modeling is a popular way of representing the behavior of a system. A very useful type of model in computing is an abstract state machine which describes transitions over first order structures. The general purpose model-based testing tool SpecExplorer (used within Microsoft, also available externally) uses such a model, written in AsmL or Spec#, to perform a search that checks that all reachable states of the model are safe, and also to check conformance of an arbitrary .NET implementation to the model. Spec Explorer provides a variety of ways to cut clown the state space of the model, for instance by finitizing parameter domains or by providing predicate abstraction. It has already found subtle bugs in production software. First order structures and abstract state machines over them are also a useful way to think about cryptographic protocols, since models formulated in these terms arise by natural abstraction from computational cryptography. In this paper we explain this abstraction process, 'experiments as structures', and argue for its faithfulness. We show how the Dolev-Yao intruder model fits into SpecExplorer. In a word, the actions of the Dolev-Yao intruder are the 'controllable' actions of the testing frame-work, whereas the actions of protocol participants are the 'observable' actions of the model. The unsafe states are the states violating say Lowe's security guarantees. Under this view, the general purpose software testing tool quickly finds known attacks, such as Lowe's attack on the Needham-Schroeder protocol. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

The soundness of these transformations, proved using abstract interpretation, guarantees the correctness of the model checking results and the validity of the generated assertion monitors (to be checked by simulation). We illustrate our approach on the SystemC/AsmL modeling and verification of the widely used Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard.

In the proposed approach, we first model both the design and the properties (written in PSL) in UML. Then, we translate them into an intermediate format modeled with Abstract State Machines (ASM). The ASM model is used to generate an FSM of the design including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on-the-fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be re-used to validate the design at lower levels through simulation. We illustrate our approach on two case studies including the PCI bus standard and a generic Master/Slave architecture from the SystemC library.},

They combine advantages of informal and formal methods. Applications of this method motivate a number of computability and decidability problems connected to ASMs. Such problems result for example from the area of verifying properties of ASMs. Their high expressive power leads rather directly to undecidability respectively uncomputability results for most interesting problems in the case of unrestricted ASMs. Consequently, it is rather natural to ask whether there exist expressive classes of ASMs for which we can prove positive decidability and computability results. In this work, we introduce such a class of ASMs. The concept is similar to the one of the guarded fragment of first-order logic. We analyze the expressive power of this class and prove that it is stronger than Datalog LITE and the guarded fragment of first-order fixed point logic. Some decidability and computability results have been proven in earlier works. © Springer 2005.},

  abstract               = {In this paper, we define a distributed abstract state machine (DASM) model of the network or routing layer protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. In conjunction with the chosen routing strategy, we propose a distributed logical topology based location service (LTLS) protocol and give a formal description and analysis of this protocol on the DASM model. The high dynamics of mobile ad hoc networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks. A strategy for such networks is geographic routing in which each network node can find its physical location via GPS or other navigation technologies. To send a packet, the sender needs to know the most recent physical location of the destination node. This location information is provided by a location service protocol. The LTLS protocol has short message delivery delay, requires small routing tables, uses relatively few administrative packets, and has very good fault tolerance properties. Our goal in defining the network layer protocol in terms of a DASM model is twofold. First, we feel that the mathematical modeling paradigm of distributed abstract state machines provides an ideal formal basis for constructing, analyzing, and validating abstract requirements specifications of mobile ad hoc network protocols. Second, we intend to utilize the resulting behavior model as a formal basis for developing executable specifications serving as a platform for experimental validation of key system attributes and exploration of alternative design choices. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These solutions are used for the efficient implementation of concurrent data modifications in the specification language AsmL. The two main contributions of this paper are (i) a more general algebraic framework for partial updates and (ii) a solution of the partial update problem for sequences and labeled ordered trees. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The definition takes care to reflect directly and faithfully - as much as possible without becoming inconsistent or incomplete - the descriptions in the C# standard to become comparable with the corresponding models for Java in Stärk et al. (Java and Java Virtual Machine - Definition, Verification, Validation, Springer, Berlin, 2001) and to provide for implementors the possibility to check their basic design decisions against an accurate high-level model. The model sheds light on some of the dark corners of C# and on some critical differences between the ECMA standard and the implementations of the language. All rights reserved.},

The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs.

The formalization was based on transition systems and verification conditions were expressed in Dynamic Logic. In this paper, the relation between ASM refinement and data refinement is explored. Data refinement expresses operations and verification conditions using relational calculus. We show how to bridge the gap between the different notations, and that forward simulation in the behavioral approach to data refinement can be viewed as a specific instance of ASM refinement with 1:1 diagrams, where control structure is not refined. We also prove that two recent generalizations of data refinement, weak refinement and coupled refinement can be derived from ASM refinement. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Competitors write programs for agents, which are supposed to complete a given task or fight against other agents. In order to achieve the best performance, programs may have to use advanced Artificial Intelligence methods. In this paper, we present a framework to build artificial intelligence games, using Abstract State Machines (ASM) for the specification of the rules of the games. Choosing ASM, we expect that the competitors will be able to understand clearly the semantics of the rules. The framework includes a compiler for an ASM-based language, allows complete control of the order of execution of agents and easy integration with graphical libraries. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Often, the only means the client has for assuring that a component performs a required behaviour is executing it and making extensive tests. Moreover, to fully validate whether the selected component is the desired one, it has to be purchased or developed, integrated into the system, executed and finally tested. This validation strategy is very costly as it requires the whole life cycle to detect whether a component is the adequate one for the system. This paper presents a proposal for specification and early validation of components. The model uses the Abstract States Machines (ASM) for component behaviour specification and the model executability for component behaviour validation.},

While IPv6 forwarding and IPv6 transition microblocks may simplify the engineering efforts needed to support Next Generation routing solutions, there must be an efficient and fast mechanism for processing IPv6 headers prior to this. In this paper, we try to develop an IPv6 protocol processing engine based on sequential predicate logic invocations. The design, based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) Logic, shows how the design features may help in resolving scalability issues for large scale IPv6 routing. The novelty of the approach lies in the formal predicate logic definition and synthesis of processing hardware and generation of physical design unit from the data-driven algorithm function computation at compile time.},

	abstract = {Model-Integrated Computing (MIC) is an approach to Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), which has been developed primarily for embedded systems. MIC places strong emphasis on the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSML-s) and model transformations. A metamodeling process facilitated by the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) tool suite enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSML-s. However, the specification of semantics lor DSML-s is still a hard problem. In order to simplify the DSML semantics, this paper discusses semantic anchoring, which is based on the transformational specification of semantics. Using a mathematical model, Abstract State Machine (ASM), as a common semantic framework, we have developed formal operational semantics for a set of basic models of computations, called semantic units. Semantic anchoring of DSML-s means the specification of model transformations between DSML-s (or aspects of complex DSML-s) and selected semantic units. The paper describes the semantic anchoring process using the meta-programmable MIC tool suite. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Metamodeling facilitates the rapid, inexpensive development of domain-specific modeling languages (DSML-s). However, there are still challenges hindering the wide-scale industrial application of model-based design. One of these unsolved problems is the lack of a practical, effective method for the formal specification of DSML semantics. This problem has negative impact on reusability of DSML-s and analysis tools in domain specific tool chains. To address these issues, we propose a formal well founded methodology with supporting tools to anchor the semantics of DSML-s to precisely defined and validated "semantic units". In our methodology, each of the syntactic and semantic DSML components is defined precisely and completely. The main contribution of our approach is that it moves toward an infrastructure for DSML design that integrates formal methods with practical engineering tools. In this paper we use a mathematical model, Abstract State Machines, a common semantic framework to define the semantic domains of DSML-s. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

Various e-science and e-business use cases are investigated to guide how to create grid systems, and determine which functions grid systems should have. Web services emerge as a standard interoperable technology for grid systems. Although the motivations and goals for service grids are obvious, there is no clear definition for service grids to define and describe the general framework and service access model. In this paper, the general framework for service grids is defined in a formal approach, and the virtual organization based service access mechanism is modeled based on Abstract State Machines (ASM). In the service access model we proposed, the Quality of Service (QoS) issue is considered for the user request. This resulting serves as a theoretical base for our service grid system, HowU. © 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Behavioral analysis of middleware-based applications typically requires the analysis of the middleware and the application, in a monolithic way. In terms of model-checking, this is a complex task and may result in the well known "state-explosion" problem. These considerations led us to investigate a compositional verification approach which decomposes the system in accordance with its Software Architecture. The architectural decomposability theorem we defined in previous work decomposes the system into three logical layer: (i) application components, (ii) proxies and, (iii) middleware. This logical separation allows for reducing the global system validation to the verification of local behaviors. In this paper, we engineer the architectural decomposability theorem to the analysis of middleware-based applications by automatically generating the proxies needed by the components in order to properly interact with each other via the middleware. In particular, following the Model Driven Architecture approach and by making use of the Abstract State Machine formalism, we describe a set of transformation rules that allow for deriving correct proxies for using CORBA. By means of the proposed transformations, the correctness of the proxy behavioral models is guaranteed without the need to validate them with respect to the assumptions posed by the theorem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

Despite the complexity and the economic significance of such applications, current practice does not always apply robust and well-understood principles. Model driven architecture (MDA) separates the application logic from the underlying platform technology and represents them with precise semantic models. Web application development there-fore has potentially the most to gain from adopting such techniques that can offer a greater return on development time and quality factors than traditional approaches. In particular, the paper presents model-driven transformations between platform-independent (conceptual descriptions of Web applications) and platform-specific (Model-View-Controller conformant) models.

  abstract               = {The Unified Modeling Language(UML) provides rich notations for representing and analyzing architecture and behaviors of systems. Among these notations, UML activity diagram is well-known for describing systems' dynamic behaviors, and it is useful to model business process and workflow. Currently, the UML semantics is informally defined in plain text and it is often unclear, ambiguous or it contains contradictory assertions. It is difficult to present the precise semantics which are taken as important in workflow system with the guide provided by OMG to the UML activity diagram. In this thesis, the alternative approach of using Abstract State Machines to formalize UML activity diagrams is presented. We propose the workflow modeling methodology by applying ASM semantics to the activity diagram. Through the exact definition to formal semantics based on ASM, it is possible to effectively model the workflow. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Higher-order logic with shallow type class polymorphism is widely used as a specification formalism. Its polymorphic entities (types, operators, axioms) can easily be equipped with a 'naive' semantics defined in terms of collections of instances. However, this semantics has the unpleasant property that while model reduction preserves satisfaction of sentences, model expansion generally does not. In other words, unless further measures are taken, type class polymorphism fails to constitute a proper institution, being only a so-called rps preinstitution; this is unfortunate, as it means that one cannot use institution-independent or heterogeneous structuring languages, proof calculi, and tools with it. Here, we suggest to remedy this problem by modifying the notion of model to include information also about its potential future extensions. Our construction works at a high level of generality in the sense that it provides, for any preinstitution, an institution in which the original preinstitution can be represented. The semantics of polymorphism used in the specification language HASCASL makes use of this result. In fact, HASCASL'S polymorphism is a special case of a general notion of polymorphism in institutions introduced here, and our construction leads to the right notion of semantic consequence when applied to this generic polymorphism. The appropriateness of the construction for other frame-works that share the same problem depends on methodological questions to be decided case by case. In particular, it turns out that our method is apparently unsuitable for observational logics, while it works well with abstract state machine formalisms such as state-based CASL. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

We defined three design steps where we first model the bus in UML; then, design it completely with Abstract State Machines (ASM); and, finally, translate the ASM code to SystemC. We considered an intermediate ASM representation in order to extract the finite state machine of the bus that can be used to for model checking of PSL properties. The final SystemC monitor block can be seen as a stand-alone PCI IP as well as a verification module to validate other SystemC PCI compatible devices. Besides, our design offers a flexible and easy to configure IP that supports a large number of master/slave devices. © 2004 IEEE.},

A message goes from one network to another; it can be lost or corrupted in the process. Here, we present a realistic but high-level communication model where abstract communicators represent various nets and subnets. The model was originally developed in the process of specifying a particular network architecture, namely, the Universal Plug and Play architecture. But, it is general. Our contention is that every message-based distributed system, properly abstracted, gives rise to a specialization of our abstract communication model. The purpose of the abstract communication model is not to design a new kind of network; rather, it is to discover the common part of all message-based communication networks. The generality of the model has been confirmed by its successful reuse for very different distributed architectures. The model is based on distributed abstract state machines. It is implemented in the specification language AsmL and is used for testing distributed systems. © 2004 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {This paper presents a simulation framework for UML models based upon a mapping schema of UML metamodel elements into Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Structural model elements are translated into an ASM vocabulary as collections of domains and functions, whereas the dynamic view is captured by multi-agent ASMs reflecting the behavior modeled by UML state machines. In the toolkit presented, input UML models can be drawn using any UML CASE Tool able to produce the XMI format for diagrams. This textual representation is exploited to initialize the ASM model for UML state machines which can be symbolically executed by AsmGofer, an advanced Abstract State Machine programming system. Tool features are described through the simulation of a simple stack-printer UML model showing the interactions among state machines by signals exchange and operation calls.},

We explain how ASM ground models help to resolve two major problems of requirements engineering, providing means a) to obtain for complex computer-based systems an adequate understanding by humans, and b) to cope with ever-changing requirements by faithfully capturing and tracing them via well-documented modeling-for-change. We point out that via an appropriate refinement method one can relate ground models to executable code. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

  abstract               = {The design of software for distributed production control systems (DPCS) is an error prone task. Ensuring the correctness of the design at the earliest stage possible is a major challenge in any software development process. In this context, formal verification is a very appealing approach in addition to simulation and testing, since it implies an exhaustive exploration of all possible behaviours of a system. In this paper, we present an approach towards model based formal verification for DPCS by means of model checking. The presented work is a part of the ISILEIT project that aims at the development of a seamless methodology for the integrated design, analysis and validation of distributed production control systems. A prerequisite for model based formal verification is the existence of a formal model of the designed system. According to the ISILEIT design methodology a system is specified and modelled using an integrative specification language that combines modeling concepts taken from two different specification languages, namely the UML and the SDL languages. However, supporting formal verification for such a heterogeneous language implies requirements on formal unification and semantic integration of the adopted modeling concepts. In our approach the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism represents the formal platform for the unification and semantic integration. We show how the ASMs, in particular the AsmL language, have been successfully applied for creating a rigorous unified semantic model that integrates the semantics of UML State Machines, SDL Block Diagrams and Story Diagrams which form the core of the integrative specification language used in ISILEIT. Besides the integration purpose, the ASMs serve as a basis for the application of model checking techniques. Therefore, the rest of the paper presents the work on adoption of state-of-the-art model checking techniques in order to support model checking of the ASM (AsmL) models. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

  abstract               = {In UML 2.0 sequence diagrams have been considerably extended, influenced by Live Sequence Charts (LSCs), a very expressive extension of Message Sequence Charts (MSC) with liveness. Nonetheless, fundamental liveness properties can still not be expressed in the new sequence diagrams. In recent work, we have proposed to solve this by enriching sequence diagrams with a simple but powerful Object Constraint Language (OCL) template for liveness. In this paper, we show how to formalize our liveness-enriched sequence diagrams using Abstract State Machines. Sequence diagrams still have several open problems. For example, the semantics of some of the newly introduced operators is ambiguous, and it is not clear how they can be used or combined with other operators. We address some of these issues in the paper. Finally, a further advantage of using ASMs as a semantic model concerns synthesis. It is our ultimate goal to be able to synthesise automatically a state-based object system from our richer sequence diagrams. ASMs are a state-based and operational formalism which therefore eases this task considerably. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

We developed a first-order temporal language, £<inf>MDg</inf>*, which expresses a subset of many-sorted first-order LTL and extends an earlier language, £<inf>MDg</inf>, defined for an MDG based abstract CTL model checking. We derived a set of rules, enabling the transformation of £<inf>MDg</inf> * formulas into generalized Büchi automata (GBA). The product of this GBA and the abstract state machine (ASM) model is checked for language emptiness. We have lifted two instances of the generalized Strongly Connected Component(SCC)-hull (GSH) checking algorithm [17] to support abstract data and uninterpreted functions based on operators available in the MDG package. Experimental results have shown the superiority of our tool compared to the same instances of GSH implemented with BDDs in VIS. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

To prove such compilers correct, a formal semantics of SSA representations is necessary. In this paper, we show that abstract state machines (ASMs) are able to capture the imperative as well as the data flow-driven and therefore non-deterministic aspects of SSA representations in a simple and elegant way. Furthermore, we demonstrate that correctness of code generation can be verified based on this ASM semantics by proving the correctness of a simple code generation algorithm. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

  abstract               = {We extend the logic for Abstract State Machines by a read predicate that allows to make precise statements about the accesses of locations of an ASM. The logic can be used to prove security properties of ASMs like that the machine does not read locations containing critical information or that all accesses of the machine are in a well-defined region of the abstract memory. The new read predicate is also useful for proving refinements of parallel ASMs to sequential C-like programs. The logic is complete for hierarchical ASMs and still sound for turbo ASMs. It is integrated in the ASMKeY theorem prover. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

All of them could be regarded as projections of mission-aware behavior trust model, by which authorization depends on not only the trust but also the cost and quantity of the mission. This paper proposes a formal description of this trust model by using abstract state machine (ASM). It will facilitate us understanding its semantics and accurate definitions, and bridging the gaps between de facto industry standards and this trust model. These formalizations are vertical refinements of the ASM based ground model for grids and could be easily jointed on it. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

It highlights the Woo-Lam's ideas for authentication, which is the strongest one in Lowe's definition hierarchy for entity authentication. Apart from the flexible and natural features in forming and analyzing protocols inherited from ASM, the model defines both authentication and secrecy properties explicitly in first order sentences as invariants. The process of proving security properties with respect to an authentication protocol blends the correctness and secrecy properties together to avoid the potential flaws which may happen when treated separately. The security of revised Helsinki protocol is shown as a case study. The new model is different from the previous ones in ASMs.},

System states keep the runtime information relevant for the evaluation of OCL expressions. However, not all new language concepts of OCL 2.0 are already addressed in that formal semantics. We show how to overcome this by introducing new components to the object model and system states defining a dynamic semantics of OCL. In order to give precise rules that determine when the current system state has to be updated according to a change in the referred UML model, we make use of adequate mathematical means, namely Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Though our ASM specification also gives a clear definition for the evaluation of OCL constraints, it leaves sufficient flexibility for application specific implementations that have to determine when constraints are to be checked. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

The idea of this concept is analogous to the one of program slicing which is an established technique for extracting statements from a program that are relevant for its behaviour at a given point of interest. These statements form again a syntactically correct program called a slice. Previous work has focused on programming languages that differ substantially from ASMs. Although the concept of program slicing does not directly extend to ASMs, it is possible to find an analogous concept for ASMs, We present such an approach. In spite of the fact that a minimal slice is not computable in the general case, we identify an expressive class of ASMs for which a minimal (static) slice is computable (and prove the computability). This basic result can be extended in several ways. We present some extensions to larger classes of ASMs and other variants for the notion of slicing. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

  abstract               = {This paper deals with testing of nondeterministic software systems. We assume that a model of the nondeterministic system is given by a directed graph with two kind of vertices: states and choice points. Choice points represent the nondeterministic behaviour of the implementation under test (IUT). Edges represent transitions. They have costs and probabilities. Test case generation in this setting amounts to generation of a game strategy. The two players are the testing tool (TT) and the IUT. The game explores the graph. The TT leads the IUT by selecting an edge at the state vertices. At the choice points the control goes to the IUT. A game strategy decides which edge should be taken by the TT in each state. This paper presents three novel algorithms 1) to determine an optimal strategy for the bounded reachability game, where optimality means maximizing the probability to reach any of the given final states from a given start state while at the same time minimizing the costs of traversal; 2) to determine a winning strategy for the bounded reachability game, which guarantees that given final vertices are reached, regardless how the IUT reacts; 3) to determine a fast converging edge covering strategy, which guarantees that the probability to cover all edges quickly converges to 1 if TT follows the strategy.

Systems are modeled with basic Gurevich abstract state machines (ASMs), and requirements are expressed in a first order timed logic (FOTL). FOTL is undecidable, however the protocol we study is in a decidable class of practical interest. Advantages of this framework are twofold: on the one hand, a great expressive power which permits in particular an easy treatment of parameters, on the other hand the modeling task is simplified by an adequat choice of tools. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

The design under investigation is a telecom system block, which processes a portion of the synchronous optical network (SONET) line overhead of a received data stream. We adopted a hierarchical modelling and verification approach which follows the natural design hierarchy. The formal specification and verification have been carried out based on multiway decision graphs (MDG), a new decision diagram subsuming the traditional binary decision diagrams and allowing abstract data and functions. The verification has been performed using both equivalence and model checking. To measure the performance of the MDG-based model checking, we also conducted a comparative verification of the same design using Cadence FormalCheck.},

In our first paper on the subject we proposed a general solution of the partial-update problem for abstract state machines (ASMs) where the problem is exacerbated by the use of nested submachines; in particular we solved the problem in the cases of counters, sets and maps. Here we propose a more general framework that allows us to solve the problem for sequences and labeled ordered trees.

In particular, the essential attributes that distinguish Grids from other distributed computing environments have not been articulated. Most approaches to definition adopt a static view and consider only the properties and components of, or the applications supported by, Grids. The definition proposed in this paper is based on the runtime semantics of distributed systems. Rather than attempt to simply compare static characteristics of Grids and other distributed computing environments, this paper analyzes operational differences, from the viewpoint of an application executing in both environments. Our definition is expressed formally as an Abstract State Machine that facilitates the analysis of existing Grid systems or the design of new ones with rigor and precision. This new, semantical approach proposes an alternative to the currently accepted models for determining whether or not a distributed system is a Grid. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

In order to show the complete processes of analyzing and testing software design with ASM, using AsmL to produce finite state machines for software model of resources mapping and resources request is also illustrated.

	abstract = {During an attempt to prove that the Java-to-JVM compiler generates code that is accepted by the bytecode verifier, we found examples of legal Java programs that are rejected by the verifier. We propose therefore to restrict the rules of definite assignment for the try-finally statement as well as for the labeled statement so that the example programs are no longer allowed. Then we can prove, using the framework of Abstract State Machines, that each program from the slightly restricted Java language is accepted by the Bytecode Verifier. In the proof we use a new notion of bytecode type assignment without subroutine call stacks.},

  abstract               = {In November 1999, the current version of specification and description language (SDL), commonly referred to as SDL-2000, passed through ITU-T. In November 2000, the formal semantics of SDL- 2000 was officially approved to become part of the SDL language definition. It covers both the static and the dynamic semantics, and is based on the formalism of abstract state machines (ASMs). To support executability, the formal semantics defines, for each SDL specification, reference ASM code, which enables an SDL-to-ASM-compiler. In this paper, we briefly survey and compare existing approaches to define the semantics of SDL formally. The ITU-T approach is then outlined in more detail, addressing the following steps: (1) mapping of non-basic language constructs to the core language, (2) checking of static semantics conditions, (3) definition of the SDL abstract machine (SAM), and (4) definition of the SDL virtual machine (SVM). The paper concludes with experiences from the SDL-to-ASM-compiler project. It is proposed that the SDL-2000 semantics can be adapted and extended to formally define the meaning of UML 2.0 class, composite structure, and statechart diagrams. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Multiway decision graphs are a new class of decision graphs for representing abstract states machines. This yields a new verification technique that can deal with the data-width problem by using abstract sorts and uninterpreted functions to represent data value and data operations, respectively. However, in many cases, it may suffer from the non-termination of the state enumeration procedure. This paper presents a novel approach to solving the non-termination problem when the generated set of states, even infinite, represents a structured domain where terms (states) share certain repetitive patterns. The approach is based on the schematization method developed by Chen and Hsiang, namely ρ-terms. Schematization provides a suitable formalism for finitely manipulating infinite sets of terms. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by several examples. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We define here a distributed abstract state machine (DASM) [7] of the network or routing layer of mobile ad hoc networks [13]. Such networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks, since storing and updating large routing tables at mobile hosts would congest the network with administration packets very fast. In [1], the hypercubic location service is presented, which considers a very strong definition of fault-tolerance thereby improving state-of-the-art ad hoc routing protocols in several respects. Our goal in modeling the protocols for the distributed location service and the position based routing is twofold. First, we support the definition and validation of wireless communication protocols and implementations based thereon. Second, we feel that the abstract computation model naturally reflects the layering principle of communication architectures in combination with an uncompromisingly local view of the application domain. Thus we can identify fundamental semantic concepts, such as concurrency, reactivity and asynchronism, directly with the related concepts as imposed by the given application context. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Turbo ASMs are viewed as black-boxes that can combine arbitrary many steps of one or more submachines into one big step. The intermediate steps of a turbo ASM are not observable from outside. It is not even clear what exactly the intermediate steps are, because the semantics of turbo ASMs is usually defined inductively along the call graph of the ASM and the structure of the rule bodies. The most important application of turbo ASMs are recursive algorithms. Such algorithms can directly be simulated on turbo ASMs without transforming them into multi-agent (distributed) ASMs. In this article we analyze the hidden intermediate steps of turbo ASMs and characterize them using PAR/SEQ trees. We also address the problem of the reserve in the presence of recursion and sequential composition. Turbo ASMs with return values are obtained by syntactic sugar. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Two operations are defined to compose sequential ASMs and returning a machine consistent with respect to updates. Due to their nature, such operations can be used to analyze and handle "behavioral inconsistencies" and to prove component and system properties. The applicative aspects of the theoretical issues introduced in the paper are shown by means of three examples: the behavioral description of a telephone system presented in [7], the ASM specification of the Production Cell case study developed in [3], and the ASM solution of the railroad crossing problem given in [12]. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

We present a tool chain which starts with the formal definition, and translates that into a compiler. The resulting compiler starts with a textual representation of the specification, and produces a program in the underlying formal calculus (Abstract State Machines, ASM). The ASM program, when executed, produces a trace of the SDL specification according to the formal language definition. In the process of developing this compiler, a number of errors were found in the formal semantics, which have been corrected. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

  abstract            = {In a multithreaded program running on a multiprocessor platform, different processors may observe operations in different orders. This may lead to surprising results not anticipated by the programmer. The problem is exacerbated by common compiler and hardware optimization techniques. A memory (consistency) model provides a contract between the system designer and the software designer that constrains the order in which operations are observed. Every memory model strikes some balance between strictness (simplifying program behavior) and laxness (permitting greater optimization). With its emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, the Java programming language needs a memory model that is satisfactory to language users and implementors. Everyone in the Java community must be able to understand the Java memory model and its ramifications. The description of the original Java memory model suffered from ambiguity and opaqueness, and attempts to interpret it revealed serious deficiencies. Two memory models have been proposed as replacements. Unfortunately, these two new models are described at different levels of abstraction and are represented in different formats, making it difficult to compare them. In this paper we formalize these models and develop a unified representation of them, using Abstract State Machines. Using our formal specifications, we relate the new Java memory models to the Location Consistency memory model and to each other. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Many programming languages allow some non-determinism for evaluating expressions. The semantics only have in common that arguments are evaluated before an operator is applied. The evaluation of one argument may be interleaved with the evaluation of the other arguments. However, programming languages usually restrict this most liberal evaluation order. For example, the expression evaluation may take into account short-circuit evaluation of boolean expressions which implies that right operands must not be evaluated before the complete left operand is evaluated. Our approach provides a generic expression evaluation semantics that only need to be instantiated adequatly. We demonstrate this approach by the example of Ada95, C, C++, Java, C#, and Fortran. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

ASM is a specification method for software and hardware providing a powerful means of modeling various kinds of systems. MDGs are decision diagrams based on abstract representation of data and are used primarily for modeling hardware systems. The notions of ASM and MDG are hence closely related to each other, making it appealing to link these two concepts. The proposed interface between ASM and MDG uses two steps: first, the ASM model is transformed into a flat, simple transition system as an intermediate model. Second, this intermediate model is transformed into the syntax of the input language of the MDG tool, MDG-HDL. We have successfully applied this transformation scheme on a case study, the Island Tunnel Controller, where we automatically generated the corresponding MDG-HDL models from ASM specifications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

The thesis has been derived from basic principles for sequential algorithms, and for parallel synchronous algorithms. The main result of this paper is that the ASM thesis also holds for quantum algorithms. We first show that, and how, a general model of quantum algorithms (based on the combination of a classical computer with quantum circuits) can be modeled by abstract state machines. Following the approach of Blass and Gurevich to parallel algorithms, we then formulate general postulates for quantum algorithms and show that every algorithm satisfying these postulates is simulated by an appropriate ASM. These "quantum ASMs" are special cases of the parallel ASMs of Blass and Gurevich, but the only unbounded parallelism is inside the quantum operations (unitary transformations and measurements). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

  abstract               = {We study the decidability of general verification problems for ASMs. This corresponds to the question whether all computations of an ASM satisfy a property (usually expressed in some temporal logic). Because of undecidability in the general case, one has to identify classes of ASMs and classes of properties in order to receive positive decidability results. One idea for this could be to put simple restrictions on the ASMs as forbidding certain advanced constructs. But it turns out that this does not help much. Additionally, the restrictions in those cases are very strong. Consequently, one has to look for others. Such restrictions may result from techniques which are intended to be used in the proofs of decidability. One proof technique is the reduction to a decidable reasoning problem in logic. In [8] and [10], this has been applied to receive some positive decidability results. In this paper, we identify further classes of ASMs and classes of properties for which the general verification problem is decidable. Each proof is a reduction to the satisfiability problem of a fragment of linear temporal first-order logic which has respectively been proved to be decidable in [6] or [7]. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

  abstract               = {Process-algebraic languages offer a rich set of structuring techniques and concurrency patterns which allow one to decompose complex systems into concurrently interacting simpler component processes. They abstract however almost entirely from a notion of system state. The method of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) offers powerful abstraction and refinement techniques for specifying system dynamics based upon a most general notion of structured state. The evolutions of the state are governed however by a fixed and typically unstructured program, called 'rule', which describes a set of abstract updates occurring simultaneously at each step (synchronous parallelism). We propose to incorporate into one machine concept the advantages offered by both structuring techniques, and introduce to this purpose Abstract State Processes (ASPs), i.e. evolving processes (extended ASM programs which are structured and evolve like process-algebraic behaviour expressions) operating on evolving abstract states the way traditional ASM rules do. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

We then show that when a language such as while<inf>new</inf> is extended with a duplicate elimination mechanism, polynomial-time simulations between the language and BGS become possible. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {PARADISE stands for Design Environment for PARAllel and DIStributed Embedded Systems. It integrates on an open platform a variety of tools covering the entire design cycle for distributed embedded systems. Abstract specifications are supported by the Abstract State Machine Workbench (ASM Workbench) from HNI which is a design environment of its own. The same is true for the SpecC environment from UCI that has been integrated as well. An alternative modeling tool is SEA from C-LAB which is based on Predicate/Transition nets. Design space exploration is carried out using the SSEA tool from ETH Zurich/Univ. Paderborn. With the aid of the CHaRy tool from C-LAB a partitioning based on precise timing calculations is carried out. It is closely interconnected to the STARC code generator for StateCharts from C-LAB. It generates code with guaranteed execution times. For processes running as software on programmable processors a dedicated RTOS is generated using the generator TEReCS based on a component library named DreaMS, both from HNI. Processes to be mapped on hardware are handled by the PMOSS tool from TU Dresden/Univ. Tubingen/Univ. Paderborn. In this paper aspects of modeling based on Pr/T-nets and aspects of the synthesis process for such models are discussed. The co-existence of asynchronous and synchronous modeling techniques is pointed out and synthesis methods for both modeling paradigms are discussed. © 2002 IEEE.},

From the functionality point of view, concepts can be divided into two kinds: element concepts and complement concepts. Element concepts capture the basic functions of a DSL, and complement concepts define some auxiliary functions for a DSL. Because extended attribute grammar and evolving algebra are used to specify the semantics of element concepts, the descriptions are formal, yet easily understood. Transformation rules are used to specify the semantics of complement concepts. In order to improve the reusability, element and complement concepts are defined at a high abstract level, and they are defined as some independent components. The definition of a new DSL follows two steps: defining element and complement concepts separately; instantiating concepts and assembling them. Based on the above idea, a DSLs development language (DD) is defined. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

Integrating Object-Z with a more concrete notation is a sound strategy.

We show that this notation can be readily translated into the specification language ASM-SL, a language that can be automatically translated into the language of the temporal logic model checker SMV. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

  abstract            = {The WWW Consortium (W3C) has recently presented a working draft of XQuery, which is intended to serve as standardized query language for XML. XQuery and other high-level query languages for XML documents are not yet implemented by commercial products. Yet many browsers have already built-in XSLT support for transforming XML documents. XSLT is a standard way of performing structural rearrangement or presentational transformation of XML documents, but formulating complex queries is, compared to XQuery, difficult and errorprone. If XQuery expressions could be translated into XSLT (e.g. by a translator written in Java or XSLT itself), the benefits of XQuery would be immediately available to a wide range of commercial products. This paper introduces a process for translating queries formulated in XQuery syntax into XSL stylesheets. The process is described independently from a particular implementation by means of an ASM (Abstract State Machine). The ASM traverses the parse tree of a particular query and translates each node into corresponding XSLT commands. The result of this translation process is an XSL stylesheet that can be applied to an XML document in order to perform the given query. The presented ASM can be easily coded in Java or XSLT to implement a prototype XQ2XSL translator. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

To provide a formal foundation for complete system specifications, one needs to put models for the different diagrams into context. We provide a formal semantics for UML subsystems that incorporates a formal semantics of the diagrams contained in a subsystem. It provides message-passing between objects or components specified in different diagrams, including a dispatching mechanism for events, and the handling of actions. It enables one to compose subsystems from sets of subsystems and allows them to interact by passing messages. We give consistency conditions for the diagrams in a subsystem and define a notion of behavioural equivalence and two kinds of refinement for UML subsystems.},

The most difficult task is to identify and remain faithful to the right levels of abstraction, to decide what should be in the model and what should be abstracted away. Abstract state machines (ASMs) give the modeler the maximal flexibility in dealing with this task. ASMs are able to simulate arbitrary computer systems on their natural level of abstraction. This is known as the ASM thesis; it has theoretical support and has been confirmed by numerous academic and industrial projects. In order to use ASMs for modeling industrial software, the group on Foundations of Software Engineering at Microsoft Research developed the Abstract State Machine Language. It provides a modern object-oriented, component-based specification environment complete with tools to test and enforce specifications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

However, most of them support either static or dynamic model checking; and no tools support to check both static and dynamic aspects of a UML model. But a UML model should include the static and dynamic aspects of a software systems. Furthermore, these UML tools translate a UML model into a validation language such as PROMELA. But they have some shortcomings: There is no proof of correctness (with respect to the UML semantics) for these tools. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present a toolset which can validate both static and dynamic aspects of a model; and this toolset is based on the semantic model using Abstract State Machines. Since the toolset is derived from the semantic model, the toolset is correct with respect to the semantic model.},

  abstract               = {A general framework for simulating security policies interactively is developed by ASMs (Gurevich's Abstract State Machines) and then mechanised by the ASM Workbench. The ASM external functions make it possible to simulate under the environmental influence the behaviour of a policy. The interactive features of the Workbench allow the simulation of the policy norms that apply to a given case study, facilitating their understanding. Possible inconsistencies affecting the case study can be automatically detected during the simulation and widely documented. The framework is demonstrated on a published, example security policy. The findings support the claim that adding priorities to roles achieves the crucial goal of consistency.},

	abstract = {We consider one aspect of the problem of specification and verification of reactive real-time systems which involve operations and constraints concerning time. Time is continuous what is motivated by specifications of hybrid systems. Our goal is to try to find a framework that is based on applied first order logic that permits to represent the verification problem directly, completely and conservatively (as explained in Introduction), and that is apt to describe interesting decidable classes, maybe showing way to feasible algorithms. To achieve this goal we use a first order timed logic that is an extension of a decidable theory of reals with timed functions. This logic permits, on the one hand, to rewrite directly and completely requirements and, on the other hand, to describe executions of various timed algorithms - here we consider block Gurevich abstract state machines because of their theoretical clarity and sufficient expressive power. Then we describe one decidable class of the verification problem that is based on notions reflecting finiteness properties of systems of control. These notions may be of independent interest, as, in particular, they give a way to describe a limited usage of arithmetics preserving decidability that is not covered by existing model-theoretic approaches. As an example we consider the generalized railroad crossing problem that we analyze in its entirety. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The semantic description presented here is based on Montages, which is a semi-visual formalism for the specification of the syntax and semantics of programming languages. The tool support for Montages, called Gem-Mex, is used to execute the action notation specification and thereby generate an environment for executing action notation programs. Moreover, the specification maintains and refines the structuring of actions in terms of facets and thus ensures that the modularity present in action notation is retained in its semantic description. © Springer-Verlag 2001.},

Unlike other logics for ASMs which are based on dynamic logic, our logic is based on an atomic predicate for function updates and on a definedness predicate for the termination of the evaluation of transition rules. We do not assume that the transition rules of ASMs are in normal form, for example, that they concern distinct cases. Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. We show that several axioms that have been proposed for reasoning about ASMs are derivable in our system. We provide also an extension of the logic with explicit step information which allows to eliminate modal operators in certain cases. The main technical result is that the logic is complete for hierarchical (non-recursive) ASMs. We show that, for hierarchical ASMs, the logic is a definitional extension of first-order predicate logic. © Springer Pub.

This can be done be applying abstraction to large or infinite data parts of the model. In our work, we introduce an interface from the high-level modelling language ASM to Multiway Decision Graphs (MDGs). Similar to OBDDs, MDGs are a data structure suitable for symbolic representation of transition systems, and their model checking. Since MDGs support the representation of abstract sorts and functions they can treat abstract models. We present a transformation algorithm from ASM to MDGs that automatically generates abstract models once the user has marked the data to be abstracted. We adapt the MDG model checking algorithms for the treatment of ASM models. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

In some sense, objects with integer dimension are partial cases of the more general realm of entities having a ragged shape and fractional dimension. Fractals of a broad class are described by deterministic iterated function systems (IFSs). Simultaneously, the iterated function systems give a base for 'automata networks' capable to realize their latent dynamics. When such a dynamics become alive (with the help of an appropriate automata network), it finishes in a steady state which is (in the general case) a fractal set. In this report, an algorithm is described for building an automata network for a given iterated function system. It is worth noting that the 'automata networks' can be considered generalizations of cellular automata, the main difference is that our automata networks have non-regular structure of the system of the cell neighborhoods. An evolving algebra approach for description of the automata network dynamical systems is also mentioned. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of IMACS.},

Characteristics for knowledge-based systems are a complex knowledge base and an inference engine which uses this knowledge to solve a given problem. Specification languages for knowledge-based systems have to cover both aspects. They have to provide the means to specify a complex and large amount of knowledge and they have to provide the means to specify the dynamic reasoning behavior of a knowledge-based system. This paper focuses on the second aspect. For this purpose, we survey existing approaches for specifying dynamic behavior in related areas of research. In fact, we have taken approaches for the specification of information systems (Language for Conceptual Modeling and TROLL), approaches for the specification of database updates and logic programming (Transaction Logic and Dynamic Database Logic) and the generic specification framework of Abstract State Machines.},

ASM is an efficient methodology to define computations based on functions and predicates through combining Tarski structure with transition systems. Therefore, unlike the definition for SDL-2000, we define the static semantics of SDL based on functions and predicates, which indirectly represent a syntax tree. The definitions according to this approach are shown to be more precise and readable. Especially, this approach can be fulfilled by doing a little modification on the current definition. In addition, since ASM is built upon a rigorous mathematical foundation, it is quite feasible to solve the consistency problem for this formal definition by combining formal verification techniques. © 2001 IEEE.},

Among these concepts are parameterized (possibly recursive) sub-ASMs. Here we illustrate their power for incremental and modular system design by unfolding, via appropriate ASM components, the architecture of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), resulting from the language layering in combination with the functional decomposition of the JVM into loader, verifier, and interpreter.We survey the ASM models for Java and the JVM that appear in [34], together with the mathematical and experimental analysis they support. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We do not assume that the transition rules of ASMs are in normal form, for example, that they concern distinct cases. Instead we allow structuring concepts of ASM rules including sequential composition and possibly recursive submachine calls. We show that several axioms that have been proposed for reasoning about ASMs are derivable in our system and that the logic is complete for hierarchical (non-recursive) ASMs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.},

These tools translate a UML model into a validation language such as PROMELA. However, they have some shortcomings: there is no proof of correctness (with respect to the UML semantics) for these tools; and there is no tool that supports validation for both the static and dynamic aspects of a UML model. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present a toolset which is based on the semantic model using Abstract State Machines. Since the toolset is derived from the semantic model, the toolset is correct with respect to the semantic model. In addition, this toolset can be used to validate both the static and dynamic aspects of a model. © 2001 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {Some formalizations have been developed in order to give a complete description of the parallel semantics of P3L, a programming language which ensures both task and data parallelism. However, the description level provided by the employed formalisms is either too much 'abstract' - unable to grasp the operational behavior of the skeletons of the language - or too much 'concrete' - close to implementation details and therefore related to a particular machine model. This paper shows how the Gurevich's Abstract State Machines (ASMs) have been successfully employed to describe the parallel semantics of skeletons of P3L completely abstracting from any implementation detail. The proposed model describes both the operation of the compiler which leads to define a network of processes starting from a given program, and the computation of the running processes. The model has been also taken as a theoretical basis to prove some of the most interesting rewriting rules used by the compiler to get a better program performance and efficiency. © 2000 ACM.},

The model removes the inconsistencies, ambiguities and incomplete parts in the informal description without adding details which belong to the subsequent software design. Such models are formulated using application-domain-oriented terminology and standard software engineering notation and bridge the gap between the application-domain and the system design views of the underlying problem in a reliable and practical way, avoiding any formal overhead. The basic model architecture reflects the three main system parts, namely for the manual and automatic light control and for handling failures and services. We refine the ground model into a version that is executable by AsmGofer and can be used for high-level simulation, test and debugging purposes. © Springer Pub. Co.},

  abstract            = {UML is widely used today for modelling complex systems. However, the tools support capabilities for UML is limited, partially due to its lack of precise semantics. There are some approaches that try to solve this by defining a formal semantics for UML, nonetheless it usually proves hard to implement the corresponding dynamic semantics. This paper presents an approach to define an executable semantics for UML that would enable tool vendors to build intelligent tools (symbolic execution, consistency checkers, etc.). We use Abstract State Machines (ASM) as underlying formalism for our semantics definition, which is composed of static semantics and dynamic semantics. A part of the static semantics was done by expressing in ASM the UML meta-model and well formedness rules defined in the UML standard. The dynamic semantics is based on a set of behaviour primitives (time, communication, etc). We define the ASM transition rules corresponding to UML actions. Using this semantic, we have been able to perform a symbolic execution of an UML model.},

  abstract               = {Many techniques long used for the partitioning and packaging of hardware are gradually being adopted for software with the move to using cooperating self-contained software components. There has been a trend over the last decade towards implementations based on multiprocessor distributed concurrent systems with software components allocated to processors. Designing the system-wide operation, synchronisation and exception handling for such a complex system becomes impossible at the level of traditional process synchronisation primitives, as it becomes intellectually unmanageable to grasp the system-wide behaviour when tackled piecemeal and ‘bottom up’. An alternative top down approach to structuring and designing the overall behaviour of highly concurrent systems implemented using components is presented. It is based on using one or more simple abstract state machines to define the system-wide synchronisation required in terms of the desired systemlevel behaviour rather than in terms of the low-level synchronisation primitives chosen for the fine grain of the implementation solution. A practical example involving the creation of a high availability processing system made up of several commercial quality computers is used to illustrate the concept. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

At the software architecture level, designers combine subsystems into complete systems using different techniques, e. g. “Architecture Description Languages" (ADLs). There exists a number of ADLs, each of which is specialized for one or more architectural styles. They are designed by different research groups with different goals in mind corresponding to their mental model on how software architecture can be expressed in the most eficient and elegant way. As a result, ADLs are not compatible with each other, so that it is dificult to present a homogeneous view of the software architecture of a system assembled from different components. This paper presents an approach how architectural styles can be combined using a concept of ADL-interchange. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

They are designed for the formal definition of complex dynamic systems. Two approaches to algebraic imperative specifications have been devel-oped in parallel during the last decade: Abstract State Machines (ASMs), initially known as evolving algebras, and Algebraic Specifications with Implicit State (AS-IS). Moreover typed versions of ASM have been de-veloped which have incorporated some aspects of AS-IS. This survey paper provides a guided tour of these imperative approaches of specification based on the state-as-algebra paradigm, and sketches a synthesis of two of them, under the name of dynamic systems with implicit state. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

We propose a methodology based on the construction of a mathematical model which reflects the given system so closely that the correctness can be established by observation and experimentation (ground model). Complex technical systems are often heterogeneous, so that different system aspects are best modelled by means of different techniques. This leads to heterogeneous ground models. To achieve a consistent and coherent view of hetero- geneous behavioural models, which is a prerequisite for any systematic analysis and validation, we introduce a common semantic framework (meta-model) based on the notion of Abstract State Machines. We exemplify our methodology by an industrial case study from automated manufacturing, the distributed control for a material flow system (MFS). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

  abstract            = {This work is an attempt to apply Gurevich Abstract State Machines methodology to the verification of refinements of real-time distributed asynchronous algorithms. We define refinements following the semantical framework of observability, however, with respect to chosen pieces of the program. The time we consider is continuous as our motivation is related to systems of control that are usually specified within continuous time framework; the same framework is valid for discrete time. We remark that refinement of timed programs is not a simple replacement of a part of a program by making it more detailed. As an example to illustrate this we take Lamport's Bakery Algorithm with real-time constraints. However, one of the key questions related to the verification of refinements is the preservation of verification proofs for the non refined initial algorithm as much as possible when verifying the refinement. This is the case for the notion of refinement we define. We introduce a notion of asynchronous timed distributed algorithm, define its semantics and discuss in what logic can be expressed its functioning. Then we introduce notions of refinement, and consider a refinement of interprocess communication of real-time Lamport's Bakery algorithm using parallel message exchange. Such a refinement, contrary to our intuition, demands some non evident transformation of the initial algorithm to make it correct. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

  abstract            = {In November 1999, a new version of SDL (Specification and Description Language) called SDL-2000 has passed ITU, an international standardization body for telecommunication. SDL is a fairly complex, graphical formal description technique for the development of distributed systems, and has been broadly used in industry for many years. Efforts to define the semantics of SDL-2000 formally have started early in 199 8. Bynow, a draft formal semantics is available, which is determined to become the oficial formal SDL semantics after its approval in 2000. It is based on the formalism of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which has been selected for several reasons including intelligibility and executability. The formal semantics of SDL addresses the static semantics, transformation rules, and the dynamic semantics. The approach taken to define the dynamic semantics is particularly interesting. Although basically being operational, it differs from existing approaches in several ways. In this paper, we address and highlight some of these differences, using a simplified specification language called SSL instead of SDL. In defining a formal dynamic semantics for SSL, we formally describe an abstract machine, a compilation function mapping SSL specifications to code of this machine, and an operational definition of the set of initial states, using ASM as the underlying formalism. Furthermore, we present in some detail the semantics of SSL procedure calls. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

Besides being a convenient tool for describing dynamic semantics the fact that we do not have to switch between different descriptional methods is found to be extremely useful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

  abstract               = {The Abstract State Machine (ASM) [16] approach has already proven to be suitable for large-scale specifications of realistic systems [18,9,22,34]. Due to the fact that the ASM approach defines a notion of executing specifications, it provides a perfect basis for a language, which can be used as a specification language as well as a high-level programming language. However, in order to upgrade to a realistic programming language, such a language must - besides other features - add a modularization concept to the core ASM constructs in order to provide the possibility to structure large-scale ASM-formalizations and to flexibly define reusable specification units. In this paper, the language Xasm, which stands for Extensible ASM, is presented. Xasm realizes a component-based modularization concept based on the notion of external functions as defined in ASMs. This paper also briefly describes the support environment of Xasm consisting of the Xasm-compiler translating Xasm programs to C source code, and the graphical debugging and animation tool. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

For this purpose we define precise abstract models for exception handling in Java and in the JVM and define a compilation scheme of Java to JVM code which allows us to prove that, in corresponding runs, Java and the JVM throw the same exceptions and with equivalent effect. Thus, the compilation scheme can, with reasonable confidence, be used as a standard reference for Java exception handling compilation. © 2000 IEEE.},

Such transaction protocols typically occur in the context of electronic commerce applications and can be formalized as relational transducers. We introduce a class of powerful relational transducers based on Gurevich's abstract state machines and show that several verification problems related to electronic commerce applications can be solved for these transducers. Our approach is, in some sense, complementary to the approach in [3].},

  abstract            = {Multiway Decision Graphs (MDG) can symbolically represent Abstract State Machines (ASM). Since there is no preimage operation in MDG due to the presence of abstract state variables, all backward reduction algorithms can not be used in MDG. In this paper we propose a simple but powerful way to construct a reduced abstract transition system derived from the original ASM by using only the transition relations of the so-called property dependent state variables VP of the property P to be verified. It is easy to be shown that the abstract system so constructed strongly preserves P, and consequently the abstract system constructed using only a subset of VP weakly preserves P. The critical thing is how to select the subset of VP. We present here a heuristic iterative reduction algorithm for verifying the properties. At each iteration step, we trace further the property dependency graph and add a noncorrelated set of state variables to the current set of state variables to construct a more detailed model. The algorithm can handle with both abstract and concrete state variables. It is completely automatic and succeeds in reducing the model and verifying properties where other tools fail.},

We demonstrate our approach on the embedded software for a mouse controller application on a commercial microcontroller (PIC 16C71), using the MDG verification tools. Inconsistencies in the assembly code with respect to the specification, as published in the application notes of the manufacturer, were uncovered through our experiments.},

Is there a computation model whose machines do not distinguish between isomorphic structures and compute exactly PTime properties? This question can be recast as follows: Does there exist a logic that captures polynomial time (without presuming the presence of a linear order)? Earlier, one of us conjectured a negative answer. The problem motivated a quest for stronger and stronger PTime logics. All these logics avoid arbitrary choice. Here we attempt to capture the choiceless fragment of PTime. Our computation model is a version of abstract state machines (formerly called evolving algebras). The idea is to replace arbitrary choice with parallel execution. The resulting logic expresses all properties expressible in any other PTime logic in the literature. A more difficult theorem shows that the logic does not capture all of PTime. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The method allows one to start system development with a trustworthy high level system specification and to link such a “ground model” in a well documented and inspectable way through intermediate design steps to its implementation. The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich’s Abstract State Machines. Through its versatility the ASM approach is non-monolithic and integratable at any development level into current design and analysis environments. We also collect experimental evidence for the ASM thesis, a generalization of Turing’s thesis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

Nevertheless, computer aided verification of ASM- programs has not yet been well-developed. In this paper we try to shed some light on the limits of automatic verifiability of ASM-programs. We introduce a class of restricted ASM-programs, which are called nullary programs, and provide an algorithm that decides whether a given nullary program satisfies a given correctness property (expressible in a CTL*-like temporal logic) on all inputs. Our decision algorithm runs in Pspace and we show that this is optimal. We also show that straight- forward generalizations of nullary programs cannot be verified algorith- mically, as some basic verification problems become undecidable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

A justification assures the appropriateness of the higher-level specification for the problem description. A mathematical verification assures that the lower-level specification implements the higher-level one and is based on a refinement-relation. This methodology is demonstrated by a well- known distributed termination detection algorithm originally invented by Dijkstra, Feijen, and van Gasteren. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

When the implementation is not done using a state machine interpreter, these notions had to be translated into the target language. This work aims to study how to translate as automatically as possible UML state diagrams into current objectoriented languages (OOLs), distinguishing sequential and concurrent execution. This translation requires to map UML notions onto OOLs ones, to adapt the abstract state machine, and to add information to state diagrams. Behavior inheritance is a key problem, and both theoretical and practical solutions are examined to ensure behavior substitutability. Then, two main ways for state representation are compared from the inheritance point of view, and automatic code generation is discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

  abstract            = {We outline a theory of communicating “Abstract State Machines”. The state of an Abstract State Machine has two components: a behavioural state and a data state. The behavioural states are shown on a state diagram, whose transitions are labelled with an “event” and a B operation. The firing of a transition is synonymous with the occurrence of its associated event. We use a synchronous model of communication based on shared events which simultaneously change the state of each participating machine. The B operation associated with a transition generally has the form G ⟹ S, where a necessary condition for the transition to fire is that G is true, and where S describes any resulting changes in the data state of the Abstract Machine. The paper includes simple examples, the translation of Abstract State Machines to B Action Systems, the translation of Abstract State Machines into “primitive” Abstract State Machines which have only behavioural state, the parallel combination of high level Abstract State Machines, and short notes on choice and refinement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

ASMs are suitable for describing Register-Transfer level designs. We then define a first-order linear-time temporal logic called LMDG which supports the abstract data representations. Both safety and liveness properties can be expressed in CMTIQ, however, only universal path quantification is possible. Fairness constraints can also be imposed. The property checking algorithms are based on implicit state enumeration of an ASM and implemented using Multiway Decision Graphs.},

An application of the ASM methodology to the verification of a pipelined microprocessor (an ARM2 implementation) is described. Both the sequential execution model and final pipelined model are formalized using ASMs. A series of intermediate models are introduced that gradually expose the complications of pipelining. The first intermediate model is proven equivalent to the sequential model in the absence of structural, control, and data hazards. In the following steps, these simplifying assumptions are lifted one by one, and the original proof is refined to establish the equivalence of each intermediate model with the sequential model, leading ultimately to a full proof of equivalence of the sequential and pipelined models.

Characteristic for knowledge-based systems are a complex knowledge base and an inference engine which uses this knowledge to solve a given problem. Specification languages for knowledge-based systems have to cover both aspects: they have to provide means to specify a complex and large amount of knowledge and they have to provide means to specify the dynamic reasoning behaviour of a knowledge-based system. This paper will focus on the second aspect, which is an issue considered to be unsolved. For this purpose, we have surveyed existing approaches in related areas of research. We have taken approaches for the specification of information systems (i.e., Language for Conceptual Modelling and Troll), approaches for the specification of database updates and the dynamics of logic programs (Transaction Logic and Dynamic Database Logic), and the approach of Abstract State Machines. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

  abstract            = {We present a systematic reconstruction of a compilation method for an extension to logic programming that permits procedure definitions to be given a scope. At a logical level, this possibility is realized by permitting implications to be embedded in goals. Program clauses that appear in the antecedents of such implications may contain variables that are bound by external quantifiers, leading to non-local variables in procedure declarations. In compiling programs in this extended language, there is, therefore, a need to consider the addition to given programs of program clauses that are parameterized by bindings for some of their variables. A proposed approach to dealing with this aspect uses a closure representation for clauses. This representation separates an instance of a clause with parameterized bindings into a skeleton part that is fixed at compile-time and an environment that maintains the part that is dynamically determined. A development of this implementation scheme is provided here by starting with an abstract interpreter for the language and then refining this to arrive at an interpreter that uses the closure representation for clauses. The abstract state machine formalism of Gurevich is used in specifying the interpreters that are of interest at the two different stages. We also justify this refinement by showing that the essential notion of a computation is preserved by the refinement and thus the refinement is a correct one. © Springer Pub. Co.},

  abstract               = {This work provides both a specification and a proof of correctness for the system PDP (Prolog Distributed Processor) which make use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). PDP is a recomputation-based model for parallel execution of Prolog on distributed memory. The system exploits OR_parallelism, Independent AND_parallelism as well as the combination of both. The verification process starts from the SLD trees, which define the execution of a Prolog program, and going through the parallel model, it arrives to the abstract machine designed for PDP, an extension of the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine), the most common sequential implementation of Prolog. The first step of this process consists in defining parallel SLD subtrees, which are a kind of partition of the SLD tree for programs whose clauses are annotated with parallelism. In a subsequent step the parallel execution approach of PDP is modeled by means of an OR_TASK ASM. In this ASM each task is associated with the execution of a parallel SLD subtree. The execution of the parallel SLD subtree corresponding to each task is modeled by a NODE submachine which is an extension of the one proposed by Börger and Rosenzweig to verify the sequential execution of Prolog. Accordingly, the verification leans on the results of this work in order to avoid the verification of the common points with the sequential execution. The new elements of the execution due to parallelism exploitation are modeled at successive steps of the verification process, finally leading to the extended WAM which implements PDP. The PDP verification proves correctness for this particular system but it can readily be adapted to prove it in other related parallel systems exploiting AND, OR or both kinds of parallelism. © Springer Pub.

We also show that the proposed method is appropriate for dealing in a rigorous but transparent manner with hardware-software co-design aspects of system development.

In this paper, we illustrate how the methodology of Gurevich Abstract State Machines can elucidate recovery and provide formal rigor to the design of a recovery algorithm. In a series of refinements, we model a recovery algorithm at several levels of abstraction, verifying the correctness of each model.

More precisely, we use the concept of multi-agent real-time ASM [17] as a semantic platform on top of which we construct our mathematical description. The resulting interpretation model is not only mathematically precise but also reflects the common understanding of SDL in a direct and intuitive manner; it provides a concise and understandable representation of the complete dynamic semantics of Basic SDL. Moreover, the model can easily be extended and modified - a particularly important issue for an evolving technical standard. In this article, we consider all relevant aspects concerning the behavior of channels, processes and timers with respect to signal transfer operations and timer operations. The model we obtain is intended as a basis for formal documentation as well as for executable high-level SDL specifications. © Springer Pub. Co.},

This paper focuses on the construction of correct compiler back-ends which generate machine-code for real-life processors from realistic intermediate languages. Our main results are the following: (i) We present a proof approach based on abstract state machines for bottom-up rewriting system specifications (BURS) for back-end generators. A significant part of this proof can be parametrized with the intermediate and machine language, (ii) The performance of the code constructed by our approach is in the same order of magnitude as the code generated by non-optimizing unverified C-compilers. © Springer Pub.

Our work is based on [BR95], where an operational Prolog semantics is defined using the formalism of Gurevich Abstract State Machines, and then refined in several steps to the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). We define a general translation of sequential Abstract State Machines to Dynamic Logic, which formalizes correctness of such refinement steps as a deduction problem. A proof technique for verification is presented, which corresponds to the informal use of proof maps. 6 of the 12 given refinement steps were verified. We found that the proof sketches given in [BR95] hide a lot of implicit assumptions. We report on our experiences in uncovering these assumptions incrementally during formal verification, and the support KIV offers for such 'evolutionary' correctness proofs. © Springer Pub. Co.},

Evolving algebras provide a formal method for executable specifications which has been employed for specifying several algorithms and programming languages. With its transition system-like rule-based syntax, the concept is as well very intuitive as well-suited for formal reasoning and verification. Following the need for structuring capabilities in specification frameworks, the paper proposes a concept for hierarchically structuring Evolving Algebras corresponding to the semantics of the system to be modeled, allowing to build up complex systems from simpler ones by several combinators. The concept can be~generalized to arbitrary rule-based stateoriented formalisms. In such systems, transitions regarded as atomic on the corresponding level are allowed to be specified by computations performed by sub- Evolving-Algebras instead of single rules. The subsystems provide a natural way of encapsulating data and behaviour while a computation is running. Communication is done via distinguished locations accessible to the participating systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

We proceed by successively refining a one-instruction-at-a-time-view of a RISC processor to a description of its pipelined implementation; the structure of the refinement hierarchy is determined by standard instruction pipelining principles (grouped following the kind of conflict they are designed to avoid: structural hazards, data hazards and control hazards). We illustrate our approach through a formal specification with correctness proof of Hennessy and Patterson’s RISC processor DLX but the method can be extended to complex commercial microprocessor design where traditional or purely automatic methods do not scale up. The specification method supports incremental design techniques; the modular proof method offers reusing proofs and supports the designer’s intuitive reasoning, in particular “local” argumentations typical for upgrading and optimizing machines. Since our models come in the form of Abstract State Machines, they can be made executable by ASM interpreters and can thereby be used for prototypical simulations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

As an example, finite state machines (FSMs) and their graphical counterpart - state transition diagrams - are heavily used e.g. for the specification of various kinds of protocols such as network protocols (e.g. TCP/IP), protocols for infrared data transmission, etc. Many embedded systems, such as telephone switching systems and television control, are directly based on state machines. Introducing generic components for state machines can raise the source code abstraction level from `hard-coded' control flow decisions such as `switch/case' and `if' to a more flexible implementation model of control flow. This paper shows that it is possible to use statecharts and their advanced mechanisms from specification to implementation of reactive systems. By explicitly modeling states and state transitions the source code is described at a higher abstraction level and thereby top-down program comprehension is facilitated. We define a set of specific design patterns to abstract state machine source code from low-level implementation to a more abstract level. Furthermore, we introduce a certain degree of genericity and thus flexibility without major losses in efficiency during the design and implementation of generic components.},

In fact, they are based on similar combinations of the same mathematical concepts: they both combine declarative concepts of first-order logic with the operational view of transition systems; moreover, they are closely related with respect to the underlying notions of concurrency and non-determinism. On the other hand, the resulting system representations differ considerably (e.g., they use distinct notations and are based on complementary system views) so that it is not immediately clear how they can be combined or transformed into each other. The work presented here investigates the formal relation between ASMs and Pr/T-nets with the aim to integrate them into a common framework for modelling concurrent and embedded systems, where Pr/T-nets are considered as a graphical interface for distributed ASMs. For the class of strict Pr/T-nets (which constitutes the basic form of Pr/T-nets) a transformation to distributed ASMs will be given. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

Multiway Decision Graphs (MDG) are used to encode both the output and transition relations of the ASMs and of the set of reachable abstract states, allowing implicit abstract state enumeration.

Aiming at the development of a comprehensive EA-based specification and design environment, we introduce the concept of an evolving algebra abstract machine (EAM) as a platform for the systematic development of EA tools; for instance, as required for machine based analysis and execution of EA specifications. We give a formal definition of the EAM ground model in terms of a universal evolving algebra, where we validate the correctness of the relation between evolving algebras (their theoretical foundations) and their EAM representation and interpretation. Our approach covers sequential as well as distributed evolving algebras. © 1996, Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.},

  abstract               = {Modes are a natural abstract way of structuring the behaviour of complex systems. The different ways in which a system can operate are associated with different modes, and transitions link modes to form mode-machines. However, mode-machines need a precise semantics if they are to be used for specifying the behaviour of critical systems. This paper analyses the possible relationships between modes and states. A number of concurrent systems described using MASCOT are considered, and their mode-based behaviour is used to motivate the semantics of a new real-time mode-machine notation, RTMMs. It is argued that RTMMs should not behave like abstract state-machines. A list of concurrent transactions is associated with each RTMM mode, and a notation is given for specifying their timing properties. RTMM transactions need not terminate when the central mode-controller switches mode, thus capturing the asynchronous way in which large systems respond to mode changes. RTMMs are given a proof-theoretic semantics using many-sorted logic, extended with the RTL occurrence relation, Θ. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.},

There are very good reasons for this and simply the existence of VHDL as standardized language had a major impact on the advance of high level design techniques. In this paper some ideas about specification and modelling techniques beyond VHDL currently carried out in the author's research group are discussed. One approach is to integrate formal specification techniques like Evolving Algebras (EA) and Z into a VHDL-oriented design environment. Other approaches concentrate on the potential of visual modelling techniques. Here techniques based on Parallel Logic Programming like Pictorial Janus (PJ) or such ones based on higher order Petri Nets are under investigation.},

  abstract            = {This paper provides the first step of a full mathematical description of the APE100 parallel architecture. The description consists of several models, atdifferent levels of abstraction, corresponding to views of the architecture provided by different languages used within the APE100 compilation chain (a crucial part of the software environment of APE100). Here we present the primary model, based on the relevant subset of APESE, a high level language specially designed for APE100 and constituting the source language in the compilation chain: APESE reflects closely the APE100 model of parallel execution and is therefore adequate for an abstract description of the main features of the latter. Stepwise refinement will lead us from the APESE model of this paper to the hardware level of APE100, using evolving algebras as specification method. APE100 provides a beautiful example of an evolving algebra which models lock-step parallelism: at each step all rules which can be fired are fired simultaneously.},

A simple operational semantics then associates, to a program, a partial function, mapping environments to runs of the appropriate evolving algebra. Due to compositionality of the semantics, it allows simple, correct and complete interpretations of usual semantic descriptions - SOS, denotational semantics, Hoare logic - by straightforward formalization of their usual intuitive explanations, putting thus the evolving algebra model in the role of primary operational model of the language. The evolving algebra model smoothly generalizes to more complex (and more realistic) situations, where other semantical descriptions become unpractical in view of combinatorial explosion of formalism.},

S-BPM Process Models are directly executable and formal execution semantics enable different software development teams to develop S-BPM engines with equivalent execution behavior. We did a state of the art analysis of existing formal S-BPM execution semantics and analyzed the required language elements of an advanced smart energy grid Process Model. We extended an existing Abstract State Machines (ASM) specification to close the identified specification gaps. To foster the understanding of the specification details, we developed a specification conform reference implementation by using the executable CoreASM language and execution tool, developed a console application as CoreASM user interface, designed test models and used them to evaluate the contribution. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Parallel abstract state machines (parallel ASMs) are such parallel algorithms, and the parallel ASM thesis asserts that every parallel algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to a parallel ASM. In an earlier article, we axiomatized parallel algorithms, proved the ASM thesis, and proved that every parallel ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a parallel algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual parallel models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that parallel ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new parallel components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what parallel algorithms ought to be. We prove the parallel thesis for the new, corrected notion of parallel algorithms, and we check that parallel ASMs satisfy the new axioms. © 2008 ACM.},

This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of these classes of algorithms. Here we extend the axiomatization and, in a companion paper, the proof, to cover interactive small-step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary. This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment’s replies but also the order in which the replies were received. © A.

  abstract            = {In earlier work, the Abstract State Machine Thesis — that arbitrary algorithms are behaviorally equivalent to abstract state machines — was established for several classes of algorithms, including ordinary, interactive, small-step algorithms. This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of these classes of algorithms. In a companion paper [5] the axiomatisation was extended to cover interactive small-step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary. This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment’s replies but also the order in which the replies were received. In order to prove the thesis for algorithms of this generality, we extend here the definition of abstract state machines to incorporate explicit attention to the relative timing of replies and to the possible absence of replies. We prove the characterization theorem for extended ASMs with respect to general algorithms as axiomatised in [5]. © A. Blass, Y. Gurevich, D. Rosenzweig, and B. Rossman.},
