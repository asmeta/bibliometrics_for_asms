In particular, we are interested in formally specifying a protocol for a set of processors in a distributed system, and then proving that the protocol correctly implements a set of constraints defined by a specific interaction model. In this paper, we use Abstract State Machines (ASMs) for both goals. First, we specify the interaction model and the proposed protocol in terms of ASMs. Then, we prove that the protocol is a correct implementation of the model, by showing that every state produced by the protocol satisfies the model constraints. © 19th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems 2006, PDCS 2006.

This yields a new verification technique that can deal with the data-width problem by using abstract sorts and uninterpreted functions to represent data value and data operations, respectively. However, in many cases, it may suffer from the non-termination of the state enumeration procedure. This paper presents a novel approach to solving the non-termination problem when the generated set of states, even infinite, represents a structured domain where terms (states) share certain repetitive patterns. The approach is based on the schematization method developed by Chen and Hsiang, namely ρ-terms. Schematization provides a suitable formalism for finitely manipulating infinite sets of terms.

Mutation testing is time-consuming and computationally expensive by nature. Therefore, automated tool support is indispensable for conducting mutation testing. Little research has been devoted to applying mutation testing to the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism. This paper presents Mu AsmetaL, an As metal-based experimental system for conducting automated mutation analysis. Mu AsmetaL supports the generation of As metal-based mutants (produced by applying a set of 44 mutation operators categorized into 4 classes), executes test cases against the produced mutants, and reports the analysis results. An empirical evaluation of Mu AsmetaL has been conducted using a set of 6 publicly available As metal specifications. © 2015 IEEE.",Abstract State Machines (ASM); AsmetaL; fault-based; Mutants; Mutation testing; quality; test suite,Image quality; Software testing; Abstract state machines; AsmetaL; Fault-based; Mutants; Mutation testing; Well testing,,,,,,,"DeMillo, Richard A., Hints on test data selection: Help for the practicing programmer, Computer, 11, 4, pp. 34-41, (1978); Jia, Yue, An analysis and survey of the development of mutation testing, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 649-678, (2011); A Measure of Test Case Completeness, (1985); Jefferson Offutt, A., An experimental evaluation of data flow and mutation testing, Software - Practice and Experience, 26, 2, pp. 165-176, (1996); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Gargantini, Angelo, Using model checking to generate fault detecting tests, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4454 LNCS, pp. 189-206, (2007); International Journal on Advances in Software, (2013); Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Abstract State Machines ASM 2005, (2005); Formal Methods and Se Laboratory University of Milan; Design and Evaluation of Mutation Operators for the Asmetal Language, (2014)",,"Latifi, S.; Arai, K.; Carneiro, G.; Debnath, N.; Vieira Dias, L.A.; Hashemi, R.; Minamoto, T.; Reddy, Y.; Saleem, K.; Shen, F.; Thuemmler, C.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES; Premier Hall for Science and Engineering (PHASE),"12th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, ITNG 2015",2015-04-13 through 2015-04-15,Las Vegas,112541,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

To do it authors consider abstract state machines as models of classical computational systems. This class of machines is refined by introducing constrains on a state structure, namely, it is assumed that state of computational process has two components: a control unit state and a memory state. Then authors modify the class of models by substituting the deterministic evolutionary mechanism for a stochastic evolutionary mechanism. This approach can be generalized to the quantum case: one can replace transformations of a classical memory with quantum operations on a quantum memory. Hence the authors come to the need to construct a mathematical model of an operation on the quantum memory. It leads them to the notion of an abstract quantum automaton. Further the authors demonstrate that a quantum teleportation process is described as evolutionary process for some abstract quantum automaton.",Abstract quantum automaton; Abstract state machine; Computational model; Computational process; Finite-level quantum system; Kraus' family; Quantum operation; Quantum teleportation; Qubit,Knowledge management; Quantum optics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Abstract state machines; Computational model; Computational process; Finite-level quantum systems; Kraus' family; Quantum automata; Quantum operations; Quantum teleportation; Qubit; Industrial research,,,,,,,"Bouwmeester, Dirk, Experimental quantum teleportation, Nature, 390, 6660, pp. 575-579, (1997); Boschi, D., Experimental realization of teleporting an unknown pure quantum state via dual classical and einstein-podolsky-rosen channels, Physical Review Letters, 80, 6, pp. 1121-1125, (1998); American Journal of Mathematics, (1936); Feynman, Richard P., Simulating physics with computers, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 21, 6-7, pp. 467-488, (1982); Feynman, Richard P., Quantum mechanical computers, Foundations of Physics, 16, 6, pp. 507-531, (1986); Bulletin of the Eatcs, (2003); Evolving Algebras 1993 Lipari Guide, (1995); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000); Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory, (1982); Ams Translations, (1963)",,,CEUR-WS ceurws@sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de,,"8th International Conference on ICT in Education, Research and Industrial Applications: Integration, Harmonization and Knowledge Transfer, ICTERI 2012",,,,16130073,9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X,,,English,CEUR Workshop Proc.,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892578975

This framework uses the Blackboard system for communication between Scout, Attack, and Analysis Agents. The combined efforts of these agents are aimed at assessing the security available on the networks, and a Decision-Making Agent (DMA) controls it all by making crucial decisions using collected information. This leads to a much better scalability and sophistication of security analyses, thus enhancing the penetration testing process. To guarantee the reliability and robustness of our framework, we use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) as a method to develop a formal model expressing this framework.

A scenario of a potential attack specifies the flow but not the content of messages. Using scenarios can reduce the number of protocol runs to be explored during attack searching via simulation. The number of runs can be further reduced by minimizing the number of intruder’s generated messages. The intruder’s ability to generate messages is limited by considering: the expected message content and type matching. Our approach uses two tools that support the Abstract State Machines method: the AsmetaL for modelling purposes and the AsmetaS for performing the simulation.

The SASL was originally specified in RFC 2222, and later updated in RFC 4422, using natural language. However, due to the richness of natural language this involves ambiguities and imprecision. Whilst there is an Oracle implementation of SASL, its documentation also contains informal descriptions and under-defined specifications of the RFCs. This paper provides clarification of ambiguity in SASL using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This clarification is based on two ASM essential notions: a ground model to capture the intended SASL behavior in an understandable way, and a refinement notion to accurately explicate the ambiguous parts of the behavior. We also show some differences between RFCs and the description of the Oracle implementation.

System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a semi-formal hazard analysis method that aims to identify safety requirements emerging from the analysis of potential interactions among components and inadequate control in the system’s design. In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a methodology capturing both the formal representation of ASM with the ability to generate safety properties from the STPA hazard analysis. This has the advantages of verifying the STPA requirements in a formal way, and giving insights for the improvement of the ASM specification, depending on these requirements.

Due to the fact that the ASM approach defines a notion of executing specifications, it provides a perfect basis for a language, which can be used as a specification language as well as a high-level programming language. However, in order to upgrade to a realistic programming language, such a language must - besides other features - add a modularization concept to the core ASM constructs in order to provide the possibility to structure large-scale ASM-formalizations and to flexibly define reusable specification units.

PDP is a recomputation-based model for parallel execution of Prolog on distributed memory. The system exploits OR_parallelism, Independent AND_parallelism as well as the combination of both. The verification process starts from the SLD trees, which define the execution of a Prolog program, and going through the parallel model, it arrives to the abstract machine designed for PDP, an extension of the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine), the most common sequential implementation of Prolog. The first step of this process consists in defining parallel SLD subtrees, which are a kind of partition of the SLD tree for programs whose clauses are annotated with parallelism. In a subsequent step the parallel execution approach of PDP is modeled by means of an OR_TASK ASM. In this ASM each task is associated with the execution of a parallel SLD subtree. The execution of the parallel SLD subtree corresponding to each task is modeled by a NODE submachine which is an extension of the one proposed by Börger and Rosenzweig to verify the sequential execution of Prolog. Accordingly, the verification leans on the results of this work in order to avoid the verification of the common points with the sequential execution. The new elements of the execution due to parallelism exploitation are modeled at successive steps of the verification process, finally leading to the extended WAM which implements PDP. The PDP verification proves correctness for this particular system but it can readily be adapted to prove it in other related parallel systems exploiting AND, OR or both kinds of parallelism. © Springer Pub.

However, for a family of systems that can be easily decomposed in sub-systems, we devise a technique to cope with this problem. To model such systems, we introduce the notion of sequential net of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which represents a system constituted by a set of ASMs such that only one ASM is active at every time. Given a net of ASMs, we first generate a test suite for every ASM in the net, then we combine the tests in order to obtain a test suite for the entire system.

The use of models and formal analysis techniques is highly demanded both at design-time, to guarantee safety and other desired qualities already at the early stages of the system development, and at runtime, to address requirements assurance during the system operational stage. In this paper, we present the modeling features and analysis techniques supported by ASMETA (ASM mETAmodeling), a set of tools for the Abstract State Machines formal method. We show how the modeling and analysis approaches in ASMETA can be used during the design, development, and operation phases of the assurance process for safety-critical systems, and we illustrate the advantages of integrated use of tools as that provided by ASMETA. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Formal methods; Safety engineering; Security systems; Abstract state machines; Analysis techniques; Catastrophic consequences; Development method; Model and analysis; Operational stages; Safety critical systems; System development; Quality control,,,,,"(JPMJER1603); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST","P.

This paper discusses how to integrate the use of a formal approach into the current normative for the medical software development. The rigorous process is based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method, its refinement principle, and model analysis approaches the method supports.

On one hand, this is due to the intrinsic complexity of the methods and, therefore, some level of required expertise is unavoidable. On the other hand, however, the methods are sometimes hard to use because of lack of a user-friendly tool support. In this paper, we present our experience in addressing usability when developing a framework for the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formal method. In particular, we discuss how we enhanced modeling, validation, and verification activities of an ASM-based development process. We also provide a critical review of which of our efforts have been more successful as well as those that have not obtained the results we were expecting.

These software-based features demand software engineering approaches and formal methods that are able to guarantee correct operation, since malfunctions may cause harm/damage. Adaptive Exterior Light and the Speed Control Systems are examples of software-intensive systems that equip modern cars. We have used the Abstract State Machines to model the behaviour of both control systems. Each model has been developed through model refinement, following the incremental way in which functional requirements are given. We used the ASMETA tool-set to support the simulation of the abstract models, their validation against the informal requirements, and the verification of behavioural properties. In this paper, we discuss our modelling, validation and verification strategies, and the results (in terms of features addressed and not) of our activities. In particular, we provide insights on how we addressed the adaptive features (the adaptive high beam headlights and the adaptive cruise control) by explicitly modelling their software control loops according to the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) reference control model for self-adaptive systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,Adaptive cruise control; Computer control; Control systems; Formal verification; Abstract state machines; Functional requirement; High-beam headlights; Informal requirements; Reference control model; Self-adaptive system; Software intensive systems; Validation and verification; Model reference adaptive control,,,,,,"P.

There exist several techniques for test generation, which, however, may suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we assume that the system under test can be divided in several subsystems such that only one subsystem is active at the time. Moreover, each subsystem decides when and to which other subsystem to pass the control, by also initializing the initial state of the next subsystem in a desired way. We model these systems and we show how it is possible to generate tests in a very efficient way that exploits the division of the entire system in subsystems. Test generation for the whole system is performed by visiting each subsystem and generating tests for it. The tests are combined in order to obtain valid system traces. We show how several visiting policies influence the completeness of the test generation process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The development process starts from a high level formal view of the system and, through refinement, derives more detailed models till the desired level of specification. Along the process, different validation and verification activities are available, as simulation, model review, and model checking. Moreover, each refinement step can be proved correct using an SMT-based approach. As last step of the refinement process, a Java implementation can be developed and linked to the formal specification. The correctness of the implementation w.r.t. its formal specification can be proved by means of model-based testing and runtime verification.

Many formal specification methods share this concept which usually comes together with the definition of refinement correctness, i.e., the mathematical proof of a logical relation between an abstract model and its refined models. Model refinement is one of the main concepts which the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method is built on. Proofs of correct model refinement are usually performed manually, which reduces the usability of the ASM model refinement approach. An automatic support to assist the developer in proving refinement correctness along the chain of refinement steps could be of extreme importance to improve, in practice, the adoption of ASMs. In this paper, we present how the integration between the ASMs and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) can be used to automatically prove correctness of model refinement for the ASM method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Application programs; Software engineering; Abstract modeling; Abstract state machines; Automatic proofs; Formal specification method; Logical relations; Mathematical proof; Model refinement; Satisfiability modulo Theories; Formal methods,,,,,"Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (14-11384S)",This work was partially supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic project 14-11384S.,"Abadi, Martín, The existence of refinement mappings, Theoretical Computer Science, 82, 2, pp. 253-284, (1991); Abrial, Jean Raymond, Refinement, decomposition, and instantiation of discrete models: Application to event-B, Fundamenta Informaticae, 77, 1-2, pp. 1-28, (2007); Arcaini, Paolo, Formal validation and verification of a medical software critical component, pp. 80-89, (2015); Mashkoor, Atif, The hemodialysis machine case study, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9675, pp. 329-343, (2016); Arcaini, Paolo, Using SMT for dealing with nondeterminism in ASM-based runtime verification, Electronic Communications of the EASST, 70, (2014); Arcaini, Paolo, Rigorous development process of a safety-critical system: from ASM models to Java code, International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, 19, 2, pp. 247-269, (2017); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Arcaini, Paolo, ASM-based formal design of an adaptivity component for a Cloud system, Formal Aspects of Computing, 28, 4, pp. 567-595, (2016); Formal Methods for Industrial Applications Specifying and Programming the Steam Boiler Control, (1996); Boiten, Eerke A., Introducing extra operations in refinement, Formal Aspects of Computing, 26, 2, pp. 305-317, (2014)","P.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of dealing with nondeterminism in an operational runtime verification approach based on the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We propose an SMT-based technique in which ASM computations are symbolically represented and conformance verification is performed by means of satisfability checking.

No determinism poses several challenges for the validation and verification activities, including the problem of inconclusive tests in model-based testing with model checker. It is a validation technique that uses model checker counterexamples as test cases. In this paper, we tackle the problem of testing nondeterministic systems by combining model-based testing and runtime conformance monitoring: the input sequences of the tests are automatically generated from nondeterministic models, then their execution is runtime monitored to check conformance of the code w.r.t. its specification. This technique provides an oracle for the test data, it never bears inconclusive responses, and it allows measuring the requirement coverage. The approach uses the Abstract State Machines as formal method for specification purposes and Java as implementation language.

Based on the information obtained from code execution and model simulation, the conformance of the concrete implementation is checked with respect to its formal specification given in terms of Abstract State Machines. At runtime, undesirable behaviors of the implementation, as well as incorrect specifications of the system behavior are recognized. The technique we propose makes use of Java annotations, which link the concrete implementation to its formal model, without enriching the code with behavioral information contained only in the abstract specification. The approach fosters the separation between implementation and specification, and allows the reuse of specifications for other purposes (formal verification, simulation, model-based testing, etc.). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,Abstract specifications; Abstract state machines; Code execution; Conformance monitoring; Formal model; Formal Specification; Formal verifications; Java program; Java software; Model based testing; Model simulation; Runtime Monitoring; Runtimes; Supporting tool; System behaviors; Java programming language; Specifications; Computer software,,,,,,,"Allan, Chris, Adding trace matching with free variables to AspectJ, Proceedings of the Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA, pp. 345-364, (2005); Runtime Monitoring of Java Programs by Abstract State Machines, (2010); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Barnett, Mike, Runtime verification of .NET contracts, Journal of Systems and Software, 65, 3, pp. 199-208, (2003); Bauer, Andreas, Runtime verification for LTL and TLTL, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 20, 4, (2011); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Chen, Feng, A formal monitoring-based framework for software development and analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3308, pp. 357-372, (2004); Chen, Feng, MOP: An efficient and generic runtime verification framework, Proceedings of the Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA, pp. 569-588, (2007); Colin, Séverine, Run-time verification, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3472 LNCS, pp. 525-555, (2005); Darvas, Ádám, Practical reasoning about invocations and implementations of pure methods, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4422 LNCS, pp. 336-351, (2007)","P.

This is due to the fact that modeling languages currently used in these areas have informal definitions and ambiguous semantics, and therefore their use may be unreliable. Thanks to their mathematical foundation, formal methods can guarantee rigorous system design, leading to precise models where requirements can be validated and properties can be assured, already at the early stages of the system development. In this paper, we present a rigorous engineering process for distributed systems, based on the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formal method. We rely on the foundational notions of ASM ground model and model refinement to obtain a precise model for a client-server application for Cloud systems. This application has been proposed to tackle the problem of making Cloud services usable to different end-devices by adapting on-the-fly the content coming from the Cloud to the different devices contexts. The ASM-based modeling process is supported by a number of validation and verification activities that have been exploited on the component under development to guarantee consistency, correctness, and reliability properties. © 2016.",Abstract state machines; Cloud computing; Distributed systems; Model refinement; Modeling process; Validation; Verification,Cloud computing; Distributed database systems; Formal verification; Modeling languages; Semantics; Verification; Abstract state machines; Distributed systems; Model refinement; Modeling process; Validation; Distributed computer systems,,,,,"Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK; Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, CDG",The research reported in this paper has been partly supported by the Charles University research funds PRVOUK and by the Christian Doppler Society.,"Arcaini, Paolo, Formal validation and verification of a medical software critical component, pp. 80-89, (2015); B Book Assigning Programs to Meanings, (1996); Alalfi, Manar H., Modelling methods for web application verification and testing: State of the art, Software Testing Verification and Reliability, 19, 4, pp. 265-296, (2009); Arvind, Getting formal verification into design flow, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5014 LNCS, pp. 12-32, (2008); Arcaini, Paolo, AsmetaSMV: A way to link high-level ASM models to low-level NuSMV specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5977 LNCS, pp. 61-74, (2010); Proceedings of the Second NASA Formal Methods Symposium Nfm 2010, (2010); Arcaini, Paolo, CoMA: Conformance monitoring of Java programs by abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7186 LNCS, pp. 223-238, (2012); Arcaini, Paolo, Rigorous development process of a safety-critical system: from ASM models to Java code, International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, 19, 2, pp. 247-269, (2017); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Agile Software Development Methods Review and Analysis, (2002)","P.

The MSL-centric framework allows the definition of the structure of MAPE-K loops using the MAPE Specification Language (MSL), and the description of its adaptation logic in terms of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). These models can be tested by exploiting classical model-based testing for ASMs that allows structural coverage of ASM models, but which is not adequate to test executions that are peculiar of the structure of MAPE-K loops. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a MAPE-based testing approach, which generates, from the MSL model, test goals specifying requirements on the control loop executions, translates these into concrete test predicates for the corresponding self-adaptive ASM, and then generates (by using a model checking based technique) abstract tests covering these test predicates. Such abstract tests are suitable to test the desired executions of MAPE control loops. The application of the approach is demonstrated on a smart home case study. © 2020 IEEE.",abstract state machines; MAPE-K loop; model checking; model-based testing; self-adaptive systems,Automation; Distributed parameter control systems; Model checking; Specification languages; Testing; Abstract state machines; Adaptation control; Classical model; Distributed control; Effective solution; Feedback control loops; Model based testing; Self adaptation; Software testing,,,,,"(JPMJER1603); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST","P.

Such MAPE patterns have been proposed by means of a graphical notation, but without a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of components interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome these limitations. We present a domain-specific language, called MSL for MAPE Specification Language, to define and instantiate MAPE patterns and to give semantics to some semantic variation points of the equivalent graphical notation for MAPE pattern. We also provide a formal semantics of the language by means of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, an extension of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formalism to model self-adaptation. Such semantics definition comes with an automatic transformation of MSL models into formal executable models, and opens to the possibility of performing rigorous analysis (validation w.r.t. the adaptation requirements and verification of adaptation properties) of MSL models. Moreover, we present our current results toward a (long-term) realization of an MSL-centric framework, where MSL is the notation of a modeling front-end, on top of richer and more specific modeling, analysis, and implementation back-end frameworks. As proof of concept of our approach, we show the application of MSL and its formal support to a running case study in the field of home automation, by modeling an adaptive control of a virtual smart home developed with the OpenHAB runtime platform. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Adaptive smart home systems; Architecture-based self-adaptation; MAPE-K pattern loops; Pattern-oriented modeling; Self-adaptive ASMs,Adaptive systems; Automation; Problem oriented languages; Semantics; Specification languages; Mape; Pattern-oriented modeling; Self adaptation; Self-adaptive ASMs; Smart-home system; Formal methods,,,,,"(JPMJER1603); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Linnéuniversitetet; Horizon 2020, (691178); Horizon 2020","P.

Specific artefacts are usually developed to complement specification with validation and verification activities. To avoid boresome and time-consuming activities when reusing models, in a model refinement specification process, techniques supporting reusability of formal development artefacts are highly desirable. In this paper, we tackle the problem of defining a technique for automatic refinement of abstract test cases for formal models given in terms of the Abstract State Machines (ASMs). We present an approach, based on a classical test generation technique exploiting model checking, able to reuse information of test cases obtained at a given level of abstraction in order to define, in an automatic way, the same kind of artefacts at a subsequent refinement level.

The MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) autonomic control loop is the most influential reference control model for self-adaptive systems. The design of complex distributed self-adaptive systems having decentralized adaptation control by multiple interacting MAPE components is among the major challenges. In particular, formal methods for designing and assuring the functional correctness of the decentralized adaptation logic are highly demanded. This article presents a framework for formal modeling and analyzing self-adaptive systems.

This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for formal modeling, validating, and verifying distributed self-adaptive systems. We show how MAPE-K loops for self adaptation can be naturally specified in an abstract stateful language like Abstract State Machines. In particular, we exploit the concept of multi-agent Abstract State Machines to specify decentralized adaptation control by using MAPE computations. We support techniques for validating and verifying adaptation scenarios, and getting feedback of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the MAPE-K loops. In particular, a verification technique based on meta-properties is proposed to allow discovering unwanted interferences between MAPE-K loops at the early stages of the system design. As a proof-of concepts, we model and analyze a traffic monitoring system. © 2015 IEEE.",Formal modeling; MAPE-K; Self-adaptation; State Machines; Validation & verification,Adaptive control systems; Adaptive systems; Multi agent systems; Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Formal model; Mape; Methodological frameworks; Self adaptation; State machine; Traffic monitoring systems; Verification techniques; Model reference adaptive control,,,,,,,"Abeywickrama, Dhaminda B., SimSOTA: Engineering and simulating feedback loops for self-adaptive systems, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 67-76, (2013); Abeywickrama, Dhaminda B., Model checking goal-oriented requirements for self-adaptive systems, pp. 33-42, (2012); Adler, Rasmus, From model-based design to formal verification of adaptive embedded systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4789 LNCS, pp. 76-95, (2007); Arcaini, Paolo, AsmetaSMV: A way to link high-level ASM models to low-level NuSMV specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5977 LNCS, pp. 61-74, (2010); Proceedings of the Second NASA Formal Methods Symposium Nfm 2010, (2010); Arcaini, Paolo, CoMA: Conformance monitoring of Java programs by abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7186 LNCS, pp. 223-238, (2012); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); undefined, (2011); undefined, (2015); Bartels, Björn, A CSP-based framework for the specification, verification, and implementation of adaptive systems, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 158-167, (2011)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); FOCAS; IEEE Computer Society Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); TOSE,"10th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, SEAMS 2015",2015-05-18 through 2015-05-19,Florence,,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

We present an improved algorithm which rectifies the weaknesses of the original algorithm, as well as a practical, fully functional choreography engine implementation in Flora-2 based on the improved algorithm. Our improvements to the choreography algorithm include (i) the linking of the initial state of the ASM to the precondition of the goal, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a final state in the execution of the ASM and its linking to the postcondition of the goal, and (iii) modification to the execution of the ASM so that it stops when the final state condition is satisfied by the current configuration of the machine. Our choreography engine takes as input semantic web service specifications written in the Flora-2 dialect of F-logic. Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of ASMs (evolving algebras) and evolving ontologies in the sense that one can simulate the other, a first in literature.

This may lead to surprising results not anticipated by the programmer. The problem is exacerbated by common compiler and hardware optimization techniques. A memory (consistency) model provides a contract between the system designer and the software designer that constrains the order in which operations are observed. Every memory model strikes some balance between strictness (simplifying program behavior) and laxness (permitting greater optimization). With its emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, the Java programming language needs a memory model that is satisfactory to language users and implementors. Everyone in the Java community must be able to understand the Java memory model and its ramifications. The description of the original Java memory model suffered from ambiguity and opaqueness, and attempts to interpret it revealed serious deficiencies. Two memory models have been proposed as replacements. Unfortunately, these two new models are described at different levels of abstraction and are represented in different formats, making it difficult to compare them. In this paper we formalize these models and develop a unified representation of them, using Abstract State Machines. Using our formal specifications, we relate the new Java memory models to the Location Consistency memory model and to each other. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,Computational linguistics; Computer programming; Formal specification; Program processors; Specifications; Abstract state machines; Formal specification and analysis; Hardware optimization; Java Memory model; Levels of abstraction; Multi-processor platforms; Multi-threaded programs; Software designers; Java programming language,,,,,,,"Shared Memory Consistency Models A Tutorial, (1995); undefined, (2007); A Unified Formal Specification and Analysis of the New Java Memory Models, (2002); Blumofe, Robert D., Analysis of dag-consistent distributed shared-memory algorithms, Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures, pp. 297-308, (1996); Börger, Egon, Why use evolving algebras for hardware and software engineering?, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1012, pp. 236-271, (1995); Cenciarelli, Pietro, From sequential to multi-threaded java: An event-based operational semantics, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1349, pp. 75-90, (1997); Gao, Guangrong, Location consistency - a new memory model and cache consistency protocol, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 49, 8, pp. 798-813, (2000); Gharachorloo, Kourosh, Memory consistency and event ordering in scalable shared-memory multiprocessors, pp. 15-26, (1990); Javaworld, (2001); Gontmakher, Alex, Java consistency: Nonoperational characterizations for java memory behavior, ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 18, 4, pp. 333-386, (2000)",,"Borger, E; Gargantini, A.; Riccobene, E",Springer Verlag,,,,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

Time is continuous what is motivated by specifications of hybrid systems. Our goal is to try to find a framework that is based on applied first order logic that permits to represent the verification problem directly, completely and conservatively (as explained in Introduction), and that is apt to describe interesting decidable classes, maybe showing way to feasible algorithms. To achieve this goal we use a first order timed logic that is an extension of a decidable theory of reals with timed functions. This logic permits, on the one hand, to rewrite directly and completely requirements and, on the other hand, to describe executions of various timed algorithms - here we consider block Gurevich abstract state machines because of their theoretical clarity and sufficient expressive power. Then we describe one decidable class of the verification problem that is based on notions reflecting finiteness properties of systems of control. These notions may be of independent interest, as, in particular, they give a way to describe a limited usage of arithmetics preserving decidability that is not covered by existing model-theoretic approaches.

Instead, our model checker [mc]square uses the simulation capabilities of CoreASM to build the state space, thereby directly supporting ASMs and circumventing a possible loss of expressiveness in a translation process. This enables our approach to present counterexamples and witnesses directly as sequences of ASM states and at the same time supports the major features of CoreASM like distributed ASMs, n-ary functions or extended rule forms. We show the applicability of this approach in a case study that also reveals possible improvements desirable for minimizing the duration needed for building the state space and its memory consumption. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Abstracting; Contour followers; Intrusion detection; Translation (languages); Abstract State machines; Case studies; Memory consumptions; Model checkers; Modeling languages; Simulation capabilities; State spaces; Translation processes; Model checking,,,,,,,"Börger, Egon, Report on a practical application of ASMs in software design, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1912 LNCS, pp. 361-366, (2000); A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Farahbod, Roozbeh, CoreASM: An extensible ASM execution engine, Fundamenta Informaticae, 77, 1-2, pp. 71-103, (2007); del Castillo, Giuseppe, Towards comprehensive tool support for abstract state machines: The ASM workbench tool environment and architecture, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 311-325, (1999); Model Checking Abstract State Machines, (2001); del Castillo, Giuseppe, Model checking support for the ASM high-level language, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1785 LNCS, pp. 331-346, (2000); Formal Methods and Tools for Computer Science Proceedings of Eurocast 2001, (2001); Tang, Calvin Kai Fan, Model checking abstract state machines with answer set programming, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3835 LNAI, pp. 443-458, (2005); undefined, (2008); Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Abstract State Machines ASM 07, (2007)","J.

Besides certain (logical) knowledge, epistemic states are supposed to allow the representation of preferences, beliefs, assumptions etc. of an intelligent agent. If the agent lives in a dynamic environment, it has to adapt its epistemic state constantly to changes in the surrounding world in order to be able to react adequately to new demands. In this paper, we present a high-level specification of the CONDOR system that provides powerful methods and tools for managing knowledge represented by conditionals and the corresponding epistemic states of an agent.

The type-2 theory of effectivity (TTE) is a well established theory of computability on infinite strings, which can be used to represent real numbers by rapidly converging Cauchy sequences, on top of which standard operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc. can be defined. In this paper we develop an extension of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) handling streams in an incremental way in accordance with TTE. This enables defining a data type Real as part of the background structure and based on this exact computation with real numbers. Output can be generated at any degree of precision by exploring only sufficiently long prefixes of the representing Cauchy sequences. We then outline an ASM development process that starts from a specification of an algorithm using Real, proceeds by making the rational elements of the Cauchy sequences explicit in a refinement, reconsiders this refined specification as a concurrent ASM, where each agent cares about computation up to some precision, and finally, based on a detailed analysis of the required precision, prunes the concurrent ASM down to an ASM that guarantees a sufficient level of precision in the outputs.

Such networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks, since storing and updating large routing tables at mobile hosts would congest the network with administration packets very fast. In [1], the hypercubic location service is presented, which considers a very strong definition of fault-tolerance thereby improving state-of-the-art ad hoc routing protocols in several respects. Our goal in modeling the protocols for the distributed location service and the position based routing is twofold. First, we support the definition and validation of wireless communication protocols and implementations based thereon. Second, we feel that the abstract computation model naturally reflects the layering principle of communication architectures in combination with an uncompromisingly local view of the application domain. Thus we can identify fundamental semantic concepts, such as concurrency, reactivity and asynchronism, directly with the related concepts as imposed by the given application context. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,Fault tolerance; Location; Location based services; Network layers; Network routing; Semantics; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc routing protocol; Application contexts; Communication architectures; Distributed abstract state machine; Distributed location services; Position-based routing; Routing strategies; Wireless communication protocols; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,,,"Technical Report, (2002); Internetworking with Tcp Ip, (2000); Journal of Universal Computer Science, (2001); Gao, Jie, Geometric spanner for routing in mobile networks, pp. 45-55, (2001); Glässer, Uwe, High-level executable specification of the universal plug and play architecture, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2002-January, pp. 3686-3695, (2002); Microsoft Research Technical Report, (2002); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Gurevich, Yuri G., The railroad crossing problem: An experiment with instantaneous actions and immediate reactions, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1092, pp. 266-290, (1996); Mobile Computing, (1996); Introduction to Parallel Algorithms and Architectures Arrays Trees Hypercubes, (1992)",,"Borger, E; Gargantini, A.; Riccobene, E",Springer Verlag,,,,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

However, many formal methods rely on a refinement-based development process which poses problems for their integration into agile processes. We consider redundancies within refinement hierarchies as a challenge for the practical application of stepwise refinement and propose superimposition-based modularization of refinement steps as a potential solution. While traditionally, each model in a refinement hierarchy must be developed and maintained separately, our concept allows developers to specify the refinement steps that transform a model into a refined one. We have developed tool support for the language AsmetaL and evaluated our approach by means of a case study. The results indicate a reduction of complexity for the development artifacts in terms of their overall size by 48.6% for the ground model and four refinements. Furthermore, the case study shows that superimposition-based refinement eases the development of alternative refinements for exploratory development and to cope with changing requirements. Thus, we consider this work as a step towards agile formal methods that are tailored to support iterative development, facilitating their incorporation into agile development processes. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Abstract state machines; Agile methods; Formal methods; Modularity; Refinement; Superimposition,Iterative methods; Modular construction; Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Agile methods; Modularity; Refinement; Superimposition; Formal methods,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Childhood Cancer Canada, CCC, (SA 465)","Acknowledgments.

OGSA includes several important capabilities needed to support Grid applications and, among them, the job management and execution capability, which concern searching candidate locations and executing and managing jobs until end. Such functionalities enable users to use distributed resources for their applications. These tasks are critical in the Grid system context because their incorrect execution can heavily affect provided services, so adoption of formal method is sometimes mandatory.

The classic, informal notion of starvation, usually provided in literature, is analysed and expressed as a necessary condition in terms of ASMs. Thus, we enrich the ASM framework with the notion of vulnerable rule as a practical tool for analysing starvation issues in an operational fashion. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Abstract State Machines; formal verification; starvation,Formal verification; Petri nets; Abstract state machines; Domain independents; Free property; starvation; Characterization,,,,,,,"David, René, Discrete, continuous, and hybrid petri nets, pp. 1-524, (2005); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Pnueli, Amir, The temporal logic of programs, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, 1977-October, pp. 46-57, (1977); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999); Gurevich, Yuri G., Semantic essence of AsmL, Theoretical Computer Science, 343, 3, pp. 370-412, (2005); Farahbod, Roozbeh, CoreASM: An extensible ASM execution engine, Fundamenta Informaticae, 77, 1-2, pp. 71-103, (2007); Gargantini, Angelo, Model-driven language engineering: The ASMETA case study, pp. 373-378, (2008); Alpern, Bowen, Defining liveness, Information Processing Letters, 21, 4, pp. 181-185, (1985); Bianchi, Alessandro, Applying predicate abstraction to abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 214, pp. 283-292, (2015)","A.

In this paper some quality criteria are postulated and investigated by combining semi-formal and formal methods. On a high level of abstractions WISs can be described by abstract locations and transitions between them.

That analysis, however, abstracted from details of intra-step computation, and the ASM, produced in the proof of the representation theorem, may and often does explore parts of the state unexplored by the algorithm. We refine the analysis, the axiomatization and the representation theorem. Emulating a step of the given algorithm, the ASM, produced in the proof of the new representation theorem, explores exactly the part of the state explored by the algorithm. That frugality pays off when state exploration is costly. The algorithm may be a high-level specification, and a simple function call on the abstraction level of the algorithm may hide expensive interaction with the environment. Furthermore, the original analysis presumed that state functions are total. Now we allow state functions, including equality, to be partial so that a function call may cause the algorithm as well as the ASM to hang. Since the emulating ASM does not make any superfluous function calls, it hangs only if the algorithm does. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Abstract state machines; Abstraction level; Axiomatization; Function calls; High level specification; Initial state; Representation theorem; Sequential algorithm; State exploration; State functions; State transitions; Abstracting; Algorithms; Computer science; Sequential switching; Technical presentations; Theorem proving,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMS-0653696); Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (250/05)",Blass was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0653696.

A query is issued during a certain step, but the step ends before any reply is received. Later, a reply arrives, and later yet the algorithm makes use of this reply. By a persistent query, we mean a query for which a late reply might be used. Our proposal involves issuing, along with a persistent query, a location where a late reply is to be stored. After presenting our proposal in general terms, we discuss the modifications that it requires in the existing axiomatics of interactive sequential algorithms and in the existing syntax and semantics of abstract state machines.

Parallel abstract state machines (parallel ASMs) are such parallel algorithms, and the parallel ASM thesis asserts that every parallel algorithm is behaviorally equivalent to a parallel ASM. In an earlier article, we axiomatized parallel algorithms, proved the ASM thesis, and proved that every parallel ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a parallel algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual parallel models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that parallel ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new parallel components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what parallel algorithms ought to be. We prove the parallel thesis for the new, corrected notion of parallel algorithms, and we check that parallel ASMs satisfy the new axioms. © 2008 ACM.",Abstract state machine; ASM thesis; Parallel algorithm; Parallel programming; Postulates for parallel computation,Abstract State Machine (ASM); Alternating Turing machines; Global time; On the fly (OTF); Parallel components; Parallel models; Parallel random access machines (PRAMs); Abstracting; Algorithms; Boolean functions; Contour followers; Evolutionary algorithms; Mathematical models; Parallel processing systems; Scheduling algorithms; Sequential machines; Trees (mathematics); Turing machines; Parallel algorithms,,,,,,,"Blass, Andreas R., Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 4, 4, pp. 578-651, (2003); Blass, Andreas R., Ordinary interactive small-step algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 7, 2, pp. 363-419, (2006); Logic Math Comput Sci, (2006); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000)","A.

In the present work, we describe, by means of suitable postulates, those interactive algorithms that (1) proceed in discrete, global steps; (2) perform only a bounded amount of work in each step; (3) use only such information from the environment as can be regarded as answers to queries; and (4) never complete a step until all queries from that step have been answered. We indicate how a great many sorts of interaction meet these requirements. We also discuss in detail the structure of queries and replies and the appropriate definition of equivalence of algorithms. Finally, motivated by our considerations concerning queries, we discuss a generalization of first-order logic in which the arguments of function and relation symbols are not merely tuples of elements but orbits of such tuples under groups of permutations of the argument places. © 2006 ACM.",Abstract state machines; Equivalence of algorithms; Interaction; Postulates; Sequential algorithms,Abstract state machines; Equivalence of algorithms; Interaction; Postulates; Sequential algorithms; Codes (symbols); Combinatorial mathematics; Query languages; Algorithms,,,,,,,"undefined, (2012); Blass, Andreas R., Choiceless polynomial time, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 100, 1-3, pp. 141-187, (1999); Blass, Andreas R., Background, reserve, and gandy machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1862, pp. 1-17, (2000); Blass, Andreas R., Strong extension axioms and shelah’s zero-one law for choiceless polynomial time, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 68, 1, pp. 65-131, (2003); Blass, Andreas R., Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 4, 4, pp. 578-651, (2003); Bulletin of European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, (2003); General Interactive Small Step Algorithms, (2007); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Technical Report, (1997); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000)","A.

Is there a computation model whose machines do not distinguish between isomorphic structures and compute exactly PTime properties? This question can be recast as follows: Does there exist a logic that captures polynomial time (without presuming the presence of a linear order)? Earlier, one of us conjectured a negative answer. The problem motivated a quest for stronger and stronger PTime logics. All these logics avoid arbitrary choice. Here we attempt to capture the choiceless fragment of PTime. Our computation model is a version of abstract state machines (formerly called evolving algebras). The idea is to replace arbitrary choice with parallel execution. The resulting logic expresses all properties expressible in any other PTime logic in the literature. A more difficult theorem shows that the logic does not capture all of PTime. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We then show that when a language such as while<inf>new</inf> is extended with a duplicate elimination mechanism, polynomial-time simulations between the language and BGS become possible. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computability and decidability; Computation theory; Computational linguistics; Polynomial approximation; Abstract state machines; Computable query; Computation model; Computational system; Duplicate elimination; Polynomial-time computation; Polynomial-time simulations; Relational Database; Query languages,,,,,"Microsoft Research, MSR","∗Partially supported by a grant from Microsoft Research. 1Abiteboul and Vianu used the name whileinvent in their paper [6], but use the name whilenew in their book with Hull [1], so we use the latter name.","Foundations of Databases, (1995); Abiteboul, Serge, Object Identity as a Query Language Primitive, Journal of the ACM, 45, 5, pp. 798-842, (1998); Abiteboul, Serge, PROCEDURAL AND DECLARATIVE DATABASE UPDATE LANGUAGES, Proceedings of the ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, 1988-January, pp. 240-250, (1988); Abiteboul, Serge, Fixpoint extensions of first-order logic and datalog-like languages, pp. 71-79, (1989); Abiteboul, Serge, Procedural languages for database queries and updates, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 41, 2, pp. 181-229, (1990); Abiteboul, Serge, Generic computation and its complexity, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Part F130073, pp. 209-219, (1991); Abstract State Machines; Annals of Pure and Applied Logic; Chandra, Ashok K., Computable queries for relational data bases, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 21, 2, pp. 156-178, (1980); Finite Model Theory, (1999)",,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,Blue Capital Inc.; Microsoft Research; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),"International Workshop on Abstract State Machines: Theory and Applications, ASM 2000",,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

We present a generic framework that tackles this problem using an incremental approach that interleaves model construction and verification. Our protocol models are based on abstract state machines formalized in Isabelle/HOL. We provide abstract building blocks and generic composition rules to support incremental addition of protocol features to a parameterized endpoint model. This structured approach controls model complexity. We can refine data structures and develop control independently, to create a concrete instantiation. To make the verification effort feasible, we combine interactive theorem proving with symbolic model checking using NuSMV. The theorem prover is used to reason about generic correctness properties of the abstract models given some local assumptions. We can use model checking to discharge these assumptions for a specific instantiation. We show the utility and breadth of the framework by sketching two case studies: modelling a bus protocol, and modelling the PCI Express point-to-point protocol. © 2010 FMCAD Inc.",,Abstract models; Abstract state machines; Building blockes; Bus protocol; Correctness properties; Generic composition; Generic frameworks; Incremental approach; Interactive theorem proving; Isabelle; Model complexity; Model construction; On chip communication; On chips; Parameterized; PCI Express; Point-to-point protocols; Protocol model; Structured approach; Symbolic model checking; Theorem provers; Abstracting; Communication; Computer aided design; Data structures; Formal methods; Model checking; Theorem proving; User interfaces; Structural design,,,,,,,"Böhm, Peter, Incremental modelling and verification of the PCI Express transaction layer, pp. 36-45, (2009); Böhm, Peter, A refinement approach to design and verification of on-chip communication protocols, (2008); Amba Specification Revision 2 0, (1999); PCI Express Base Specification Revision 2 0; Isabelle Hol A Proof Assistant for Higher Order Logic, (2002); Formal Verification of Gate Level Computer Systems, (2009); Computer Aided Verification of Coordinating Processes, (1994); Nipkow, Tobias, I/O automata in isabelle/HOL, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 996, pp. 101-119, (1995); Helmink, Leen, Proof-checking a data link protocol, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 806 LNCS, pp. 127-165, (1994); Proceedings of the 7th IFIP Wg6 1 International Conference on Formal Description Techniques VII, (1995)","P.

This was accomplished in three different ways, leading to three, seemingly disparate, notions of effectiveness.

Techniques to assure the quality of these applications are thus needed in order to identify in advance possible faults. Model-driven approaches to the testing of Web Applications can provide developers with a way of checking the conformance of the actual Web Application with respect to the model built from the requirements. These approaches can be used to automatically generate from the model a set of test cases satisfying certain coverage criteria, and thus can be integrated in a classical test driven development process. In this paper we present an automated technique for Web Application testing using a model-driven approach.

They abstract however almost entirely from a notion of system state. The method of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) offers powerful abstraction and refinement techniques for specifying system dynamics based upon a most general notion of structured state. The evolutions of the state are governed however by a fixed and typically unstructured program, called 'rule', which describes a set of abstract updates occurring simultaneously at each step (synchronous parallelism). We propose to incorporate into one machine concept the advantages offered by both structuring techniques, and introduce to this purpose Abstract State Processes (ASPs), i.e. evolving processes (extended ASM programs which are structured and evolve like process-algebraic behaviour expressions) operating on evolving abstract states the way traditional ASM rules do. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,Artificial intelligence; Computers; Abstract state machines; Algebraic languages; One-machine; Refinement techniques; State process; System Dynamics; System state; Unstructured programs; Algebra,,,,,,,"B Book, (1996); Blass, Andreas R., Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 4, 4, pp. 578-651, (2003); Bolognesi, Tommaso, Introduction to the ISO specification language LOTOS, Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 14, 1, pp. 25-59, (1987); Börger, Egon, Why use evolving algebras for hardware and software engineering?, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1012, pp. 236-271, (1995); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999); Formal Aspects of Computing, (2002); Börger, Egon, The origins and the development of the ASM method for high level system design and analysis, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 8, 1, pp. 2-74, (2002); Börger, Egon, Remarks on turbo ASMs for functional equations and recursion schemes, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2589, pp. 218-228, (2003); Börger, Egon, Composition and submachine concepts for sequential ASMs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1862, pp. 41-60, (2000); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003)","T.

For this reason, architectural patterns, like the Model–View–Controller (MVC), are usually employed. The MVC aims to separate the representation of information (model) from its presentation to the user (view). One can use a formal model to study the system and the UI, but such formal models are separately developed and analyzed, and the results of the analysis cannot be assured for the actual implementation. To address this problem, we introduced the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), allowing the integration of Asmeta specifications into the model of the MVC-designed software. This paper extends the fMVC pattern and the framework to better support Java Swing components and enhance error management, including automatic model state rollback on input failure. Moreover, we propose an extension enabling testers to generate and reuse Avalla scenarios for UI validation. We demonstrate the framework’s application, covering modeling, validation, and verification at the model level for the AMAN case study that inspired us during the definition of the fMVC pattern. Moreover, we show how the AMAN UI can be implemented and tested by our approach. © The Author(s) 2025.",Abstract state machines; Asmeta; Model-based testing; Model–view–controller,Integration testing; Specifications; Abstract state machines; Asmeta; Development and testing; Formal modeling; Model based testing; Model-view controller; MVC pattern; Software functionality; Software maintainability; Software modularity; Model checking,,,,,Università degli studi di Bergamo; (PNC0000003 – CUP: B53C22006700001),Open access funding provided by Universit\u00E0 degli studi di Bergamo within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Manually converting formal models into code poses challenges such as increased costs, limitations in specification reuse, and the potential for introducing errors. To overcome these limitations, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches enable developers to generate software code automatically. This paper proposes the Asmeta2Java tool for the automatic translation of formal Asmeta specifications into executable Java code. The designers start at an abstract level and perform refinement steps and verification activities. At the end, they automatically generates the code by applying the model-to-code transformation. Moreover, a process to validate and evaluate the transformation is presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,Codes (symbols); Cosine transforms; Java programming language; Quality assurance; Systems analysis; Abstract levels; Abstract state machines; Automatic translation; Executables; Formal modeling; Java codes; Model-driven Engineering; Real systems; Reuse; Software codes; Formal specification,,,,,(PNC0000003),The work of Andrea Bombarda is supported by PNRR-ANTHEM (AdvaNced Technologies for Human-centrEd Medicine)-Grant PNC0000003 \u2013 CUP: B53C22006700001-Spoke 1-Pilot 1.4.,"B Book Assigning Programs to Meanings, (1996); Arcaini, Paolo, The ASMETA Approach to Safety Assurance of Software Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12750 LNCS, pp. 215-238, (2021); Arcaini, Paolo, AsmetaSMV: A way to link high-level ASM models to low-level NuSMV specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5977 LNCS, pp. 61-74, (2010); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Bombarda, Andrea, formal MVC: A Pattern for the Integration of ASM Specifications in UI Development, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 14010 LNCS, pp. 340-357, (2023); Bonfanti, Silvia, Generation of C++ unit tests from abstract state machines specifications, pp. 185-193, (2018); Bonfanti, Silvia, AsmetaA: Animator for abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 369-373, (2018); Bonfanti, Silvia, Validation of transformation from abstract state machine models to C++ code, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11146 LNCS, pp. 17-32, (2018); Bonfanti, Silvia, Design and validation of a C++ code generator from Abstract State Machines specifications, Journal of Software: Evolution and Process, 32, 2, (2020); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003)","A.

The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern is typically used in user interfaces (UIs), since it allows the separation between the internal representation of the information and the way it is shown to users. The main problem of using this approach in a formal setting, where formal models are used to specify the requirements and prove safety properties, is that those models are not directly used within the MVC pattern and, thus, all the activities performed at model-level are somehow lost when implementing the UI. For this reason, in this paper, we present the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), an extension of the classical MVC where the model is a formal specification, written using Abstract State Machines. This pattern is supported by the AsmetaFMVCLib, which allows the user to link the formal model with the view and the controller by using simple Java annotations. We present the application of fMVC on a simple example of a calculator for explanatory purposes, then we apply it to the AMAN case study, which has inspired the definition of fMVC. We discuss the advantages of fMVC and its shortcomings, trying to identify the scenarios where it should be applied and possible alternatives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Formal specification; Architectural pattern; Complex software systems; Formal modeling; Formal setting; Internal representation; Model-view controller; MVC pattern; Safety property; Simple++; User interface development; User interfaces,,,,,,,"Arcaini, Paolo, The ASMETA Approach to Safety Assurance of Software Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12750 LNCS, pp. 215-238, (2021); Arlt, Stephan, Verification of GUI applications: A black-box approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8802, pp. 236-252, (2014); Bombarda, Andrea, Extending ASMETA with Time Features, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12709 LNCS, pp. 105-111, (2021); Bucanek, James, Learn objective-C for Java developers, pp. 1-493, (2009); Campos, José Creisssac, Systematic analysis of control panel interfaces using formal tools, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5136 LNCS, pp. 72-85, (2008); Campos, José Creisssac, Supporting the analysis of safety critical user interfaces: An Exploration of Three Formal Tools, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 27, 5, (2020); Validity Threats in Empirical Software Engineering Research an Initial Survey, (2010); Ge, Ning, Formal development process of safety-critical embedded human machine interface systems, 2018-January, pp. 1-8, (2017); Geniet, Romain, Refinement based formal development of human-machine interface, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11176 LNCS, pp. 240-256, (2018); Masci, Paolo M., PVSio-web 2.0: Joining PVS to HCI, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9206, pp. 470-478, (2015)","A.

The application of a rigorous process for their development reduces the risk of failures since validation and verification activities can be performed in a objective, reproducible, and documentable manner. In this paper we present an approach based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method. Starting from the model, validation and verification (V&V) techniques can be applied. Furthermore, by step-wise refinement, a final model can be obtained, which can be automatically translated to code. The process is applied to the smart pill box case study. Starting from the ASM model, we generate code for the Arduino platform after the application of V&V activities. Furthermore, we introduce regulation (IEC62304) and guidelines (FDA General Principles of Software Validation) that support the developer in medical software development.

The RATE approach consists in generating test sequences from ASMs and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. The process follows these steps: (1) model the system as an abstract state machine; (2) validate and verify the model; (3) generate test sequences automatically from the ASM model; (4) execute the tests over the implementation and compute the code coverage; (5) if the coverage is below the desired threshold, then refine the abstract state machine model to add the uncovered functionalities and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach in three case studies: a traffic light control system (TLCS), the IEEE 11073-20601 personal health device (PHD) protocol, and the mechanical ventilator Milano (MVM). By applying RATE, at each refinement level, we have increased code coverage and identified some faults or conformance errors for all the case studies.

Such processes generally rely on formal methods, which can guarantee, thanks to their mathematical foundation, model preciseness, and properties assurance. However, they are rarely adopted in practice. In this paper, we report our experience in using the Abstract State Machine formal method and the ASMETA framework in developing a prototype of the control software of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to time constraints and lack of skills, no formal method was applied for the MVM project. However, we here want to assess the feasibility of developing (part of) the ventilator by using a formal method-based approach. Our development process starts from a high-level formal specification of the system to describe the MVM main operation modes. Then, through a sequence of refined models, all the other requirements are captured, up to a level in which a C++ implementation of a prototype of the MVM controller is automatically generated from the model, and tested. Along the process, at each refinement level, different model validation and verification activities are performed, and each refined model is proved to be a correct refinement of the previous level. By means of the MVM case study, we evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our formal approach. © A. Bombarda, S. Bonfanti, A. Gargantini & E.

We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests.

Starting from system models, users are able to automatically generate machine code in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Asm2C++ [4] is the tool that transforms Abstract State Machine models to code. However, no validation activities have been performed in the past to guarantee the correctness of the transformation process. In this paper, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. Coverage measures give a user the confidence that the generated code has the same behavior as specified by the ASM model. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.",,Codes (symbols); Cosine transforms; Semantics; Software testing; Systems analysis; Abstract state machines; Automatic transformations; Code transformation; Machine codes; Model-driven Engineering; System models; Transformation process; Unit tests; C++ (programming language),,,,,"Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft, BMWFW; Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT","The writing of this article is supported by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, and the Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET center SCCH.","Ab Rahim, Lukman Bin, A survey of approaches for verifying model transformations, Software and Systems Modeling, 14, 2, pp. 1003-1028, (2015); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Baudry, Benoît, Barriers to systematic model transformation testing, Communications of the ACM, 53, 6, pp. 139-143, (2010); Bonfanti, Silvia, Asm2C++: A tool for code generation from abstract state machines to Arduino, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10227 LNCS, pp. 295-301, (2017); Bonfanti, Silvia, Generation of C++ unit tests from abstract state machines specifications, pp. 185-193, (2018); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Calegari, Daniel, Verification of model transformations: A survey of the state-of-the-art, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 292, pp. 5-25, (2013); Conrad, Mirko, Testing-based translation validation of generated code in the context of IEC 61508, Formal Methods in System Design, 35, 3, pp. 389-401, (2009); France, Robert B., Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, pp. 37-54, (2007); Küster, Jochen Malte, Validation of model transformations - First experiences using a white box approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4364 LNCS, pp. 193-204, (2007)","S.

If models are executable, as for state-based formal specifications, engines to orchestrate the simulation of separate component operational models are extremely useful. This paper presents an approach for the co-simulation, according to predefined orchestration schemas, of state-based models of separate components of a Discrete Event System. More precisely, we exploit the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method as state-based formalism, and we (i) define a set of operators to compose ASMs that communicate with each other through I/O events, and (ii) present an engine to execute the compositional simulation of the ASMs as a whole assembly. As proof of concepts, we use a set of model examples of Discrete Event Systems of increasing complexity to show the application of our approach and to evaluate its effectiveness in co-simulating models of real systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To keep requirements complexity under control, system components are specified by separate models, validated and verified in isolation from the rest, but models have to be subsequently integrated and validated as a whole.

Essentially, separate ASMs represent the behavior of interacting subsystems of the MVM with their new adaptive functionalities; they can communicate with each other through I/O events, and co-operate by a precise orchestration schema. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",ASMETA; Compositional I/O Abstract State Machines; Discrete Event Systems modeling,COVID-19; Abstract state machines; ASMETA; Composable; Composition operators; Compositional I/O abstract state machine; Discrete event system modelling; Model-based system development; Software intensive systems; System composition; System models; Discrete event simulation,,,,,,,"undefined; undefined; undefined; Abba, Andrea, The novel Mechanical Ventilator Milano for the COVID-19 pandemic, Physics of Fluids, 33, 3, (2021); undefined; 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power Supplies º in 2021 23rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Bencomo, Nelly, Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, Software and Systems Modeling, 18, 5, pp. 3049-3082, (2019); Bombarda, Andrea, Developing a prototype of a mechanical ventilator controller from requirements to code with ASMETA, Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, EPTCS, 349, pp. 13-29, (2021); Liquidity Analysis in Resource Aware Programming; Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018)","S.

Moreover, compositional model simulation is recognized as the only alternative available in practice when systems are large and complex, like in the cyber-physical domain, and intrinsically require combining the specification of ensembles of different parts (subsystems). Therefore, the need for simulation engines for composed model execution is getting a growing interest. Along this research line, this paper presents the results of the compositional modeling and validation by scenarios of an industrial medical system, called MVM-Adapt, that we designed as an adaptive version of an existing mechanical lung ventilator deployed and certified to treat pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit the I/O Abstract State Machine formalism to model the device components as separate and interacting sub-systems that communicate through I/O events and adapt the device ventilation mode at run-time based on the health parameters of the patient. An orchestrated simulation coordinates the overall execution of these communicating I/O ASMs by exploiting suitable workflow patterns. This compositional simulation technique has proved to be useful in practice to validate the new adaptive MVM's behavior and thus to support architects in better understanding this new mode of operation of the prototyped system. © 2025 The Author(s)",Abstract State Machines; Compositional model-based simulation; Discrete Event Systems modeling; Models@run.time,Abstract state machines; Compositional model-based simulation; Compositional models; Design of softwares; Discrete event system modelling; Model-based simulations; Model@run.; Modeling simulation; Software intensive systems; Time,,,,,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; European Commission, EC, (CUP F53D23004230006); European Commission, EC; (959)","We acknowledge the financial support of the project PRIN 2022 SAFEST (Trust assurance of Digital Twins for medical cyber-physical systems), funded by the European Union - Next Generation EU, Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.1, CUP F53D23004230006, under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) \u2013 Grant Assignment Decree No. 959 adopted on 30 June 2023 by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR).","Talcott, Carolyn L., Composition of Languages, Models, and Analyses, pp. 45-70, (2021); Bañares, José Ángel, Model and Simulation Engines for Distributed Simulation of Discrete Event Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11113 LNCS, pp. 77-91, (2019); Weyns, Danny, Model-based simulation at runtime for self-adaptive systems, pp. 364-373, (2016); Bencomo, Nelly, Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, Software and Systems Modeling, 18, 5, pp. 3049-3082, (2019); Fuller, Aidan, Digital Twin: Enabling Technologies, Challenges and Open Research, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 108952-108971, (2020); Abba, Andrea, The novel Mechanical Ventilator Milano for the COVID-19 pandemic, Physics of Fluids, 33, 3, (2021); Bonfanti, Silvia, Compositional Simulation of Abstract State Machines for Safety Critical Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13712 LNCS, pp. 3-19, (2022); undefined, (2024); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018); Arcaini, Paolo, The ASMETA Approach to Safety Assurance of Software Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12750 LNCS, pp. 215-238, (2021)","S.

Safety assurance at runtime can be addressed by using models formalizing those safety assertions the system has to guarantee during operation, and specifying enforcement strategies aimed at preserving or eventually restoring safety. This paper presents an approach to runtime safety enforcement of software systems based on the MAPE-K control loop architecture for system monitoring and control, and on the State Machine as runtime model to specify safety assertions and enforcement strategies for steering the correct system behavior. The enforcer software is designed to act as a proxy system which wraps around the software system to realize safety enforcement, both as black-box enforcement on unsafe I/O events and as gray-box enforcement on unsafe internal system changes.

The construction of an ASM model for the basic S-BPM concepts revealed a strong relation between S-BPM and the ASM method for software design and analysis. In this paper we investigate this relation more closely. We use the analysis to evaluate S-BPM as an approach to business process modeling and to suggest some challenging practical extension of the S-BPM system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.,,Process engineering; Abstract state machines; Business process model; Design and analysis; Semantical foundations; Subject-oriented; Software design,,,,,,,"B Book, (1996); Modeling in Event B System and Software Engineering, (2010); Batory, Don S., Modularizing theorems for software product lines: The jbook case study, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 14, 12, pp. 2059-2082, (2008); Börger, Egon, A logical operational semantics of full prolog: Part I. selection core and control, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 440 LNCS, pp. 36-64, (1990); Börger, Egon, A logical operational semantics of full prolog: Part II. built-in predicates for database manipulations, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 452 LNCS, pp. 1-14, (1990); Berkeley Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications, (1992); Börger, Egon, Logic programming: The evolving algebra approach, A-51, pp. 391-395, (1994); Börger, Egon, Why use evolving algebras for hardware and software engineering?, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1012, pp. 236-271, (1995); Specification and Semantics, (1996); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999)","E.

Starting from the fundamental notion of virtual machine computations, which is phrased for both synchronous and asynchronous systems in terms of Abstract State Machines, the course covers in a uniform way the basics of algorithms (sequential and distributed computations) and formal languages (grammars and automata) as well as the computational content of the major programming paradigms and high-level system design principles. The course constitutes a basis for advanced courses on algorithms and their complexity as well as on rigorous methods for requirements capture and for practical hardware/software design and analysis. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computer aided analysis; Design; Distributed computer systems; Formal languages; Formal methods; Systems analysis; Teaching; Abstract state machines; Computational contents; Computer-based system; Distributed computations; Hardware/software design; Programming paradigms; Requirements Capture; Undergraduate Courses; Curricula,,,,,,,"Abiteboul, Serge, Relational transducers for electronic commerce, Proceedings of the ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, pp. 179-187, (1998); B Book, (1996); Xasm Open Source, (2001); Barnett, Mike, Using abstract state machines at Microsoft: A case study, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1912 LNCS, pp. 367-379, (2000); J Systems and Software, (2002); Beierle, Christoph, Refinement of a typed WAM extension by polymorphic order-sorted types, Formal Aspects of Computing, 8, 5, pp. 539-564, (1996); Beierle, Christoph, Specification and correctness proof of a WAM extension with abstract type constraints, Formal Aspects of Computing, 8, 4, pp. 428-462, (1996); ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, (2002); Computability Complexity Logic, (1989); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999)","E.

The method enhances traditional operational modelling and analysis techniques by incorporating the most general abstraction, decomposition and refinement mechanisms which have become available through Gurevich’s Abstract State Machines.

The description consists of several models, atdifferent levels of abstraction, corresponding to views of the architecture provided by different languages used within the APE100 compilation chain (a crucial part of the software environment of APE100). Here we present the primary model, based on the relevant subset of APESE, a high level language specially designed for APE100 and constituting the source language in the compilation chain: APESE reflects closely the APE100 model of parallel execution and is therefore adequate for an abstract description of the main features of the latter. Stepwise refinement will lead us from the APESE model of this paper to the hardware level of APE100, using evolving algebras as specification method. APE100 provides a beautiful example of an evolving algebra which models lock-step parallelism: at each step all rules which can be fired are fired simultaneously.",,Boolean algebra; Data structures; Digital arithmetic; Mathematical models; Parallel processing systems; Program compilers; Program processors; Software engineering; APE100 architecture; APESE model; Evolving algebra; Lattice gauge theory; Master controller; Special purpose and application based systems; Computer architecture,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.,,Proceedings of the IFIP 13th World Computer Congress.

We introduce Abstract State Machine Nets (ASM Nets) whose component ASMs can be defined using a simple combination of textual (data-oriented) and intuitive graphical (controlflow oriented) yet semantically rigorously defined descriptive means. This allows the BP experts to design BPMs whose underlying ASM Nets constitute a reliable precise contract-a contract which guarantees the BP domain experts that the application-domain focussed understanding of the BPMs they design is also a correct understanding of the code behavior provided by the implementation of the models by software experts. This paves the way for the development of certifiably correct BPMs and their implementations. To illustrate one practical and one conceptual application of the concept we a) instantiate ASM Nets to model the behavioral meaning of the graphical and textual notations used in the commercial S-BPM tool suite with its focus on communication (service interaction) and b) show that applying the rigorous ASM refinement concept to ASM Nets supports IBM's Guard-Stage-Milestone approach to adaptive case management by an accurate conceptual foundation. © 2015 ACM.,,Application programs; Enterprise resource management; Abstract state machines; Business process model; Case management; Conceptual foundations; Domain experts; Model implementation; Service interaction; Textual notation; Administrative data processing,,,,,,,"Object Management Group; undefined, (2011); Case Management Model and Notation Cmmn, (2013); B Book, (1996); Modeling in Event B System and Software Engineering, (2010); Altenhofen, Michael, A high-level specification for virtual providers, International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management, 1, 4, pp. 267-278, (2006); Web Services Business Process Execution Language, (2025); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999); Börger, Egon, The ASM ground model method as a foundation of requirements engineering, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2772, pp. 145-160, (2004); Börger, Egon, The ASM Refinement Method, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 2-3, pp. 237-257, (2003)",,"Ehlers, J.; Thalheim, B.",Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org,Christian-Albrechts-Universitat zu Kiel (CAU); ConsSys IT AG; et al.; Institute of Innovative Process Management; METASONIC; Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein,"7th International Conference on Subject-Oriented Business Process Management, S-BPM ONE 2015",2015-04-23 through 2015-04-24,Kiel,119310,21531633,9781450377881; 9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201,,,English,ACM Int.

We proceed by successively refining a one-instruction-at-a-time-view of a RISC processor to a description of its pipelined implementation; the structure of the refinement hierarchy is determined by standard instruction pipelining principles (grouped following the kind of conflict they are designed to avoid: structural hazards, data hazards and control hazards). We illustrate our approach through a formal specification with correctness proof of Hennessy and Patterson’s RISC processor DLX but the method can be extended to complex commercial microprocessor design where traditional or purely automatic methods do not scale up. The specification method supports incremental design techniques; the modular proof method offers reusing proofs and supports the designer’s intuitive reasoning, in particular “local” argumentations typical for upgrading and optimizing machines.

The proposed method relies on the combination of its abstraction concept and its operational character, with behavioral models in the precise and simple form of Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The book introduces both the modeling method (Part I) and the available tool support (Part II): In Part I the authors detail (using numerous examples) how to construct, explain, debug, explore, extend and reuse accurate system design models, starting from scratch. Only an elementary knowledge of common mathematical (including set-theoretic) notation and some basic experience with computational processes (systems, programs, algorithms) is assumed. Part II then shows how the modeling method can be supported by implementing tools that make design models executable and debuggable. To illustrate how to build, debug and maintain systems and to explain their construction in a checkable manner, a general, problem-oriented refinement method is adopted to construct system models from components. The method starts with abstract models and refines them step by step, incrementally adding further details that eventually lead to code. Intended for practitioners who build software intensive systems, and students specializing in software engineering, it can be used both for self-study and for teaching, and it can serve as a reference book. Exercises are included to help readers check their understanding of the explained concepts.

Gurevich's behavioural theory of sequential algorithms (aka the sequential ASM thesis) gives a partial answer by defining (non-deterministic) sequential algorithms axiomatically, without referring to a particular machine model or programming language, and showing that they are captured by (nondeterministic) sequential Abstract State Machines (nd-seq ASMs). However, recursive algorithms such as mergesort are not covered by this theory, as has been pointed out by Moschovakis, who had independently developed a different framework to mathematically characterize the concept of (in particular recursive) algorithm. In this article we propose an axiomatic definition of the notion of sequential recursive algorithm which extends Gurevich's axioms for sequential algorithms by a Recursion Postulate and allows us to prove that sequential recursive algorithms are captured by recursive Abstract State Machines, an extension of nd-seq ASMs by a CALL rule. Applying this recursive ASM thesis yields a characterization of sequential recursive algorithms as finitely composed concurrent algorithms all of whose concurrent runs are partial-order runs. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, we remained intrigued by the fact that Blass and Gurevich used partial-order runs of distributed ASMs to explain runs of sequential recursive algorithms. We discovered that also the inverse simulation holds: for every distributed ASM with partial order runs, these runs can be described by runs of a sequential recursive algorithm.

We show in particular that one can tailor business process definitions in application-domain yet rigorous terms in such a way that the resulting ASM models can be used as basis for binding contracts between domain experts and IT technologists. The method combines the expressive power and accuracy of rule-based modeling with the intuition provided by visual graph-based descriptions. We illustrate this by an ASM-based semantical framework for the OMG standard for BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The framework supports true concurrency, heterogeneous state and modularity (compositional design and verification techniques). As validation example we report some experiments, carried out with a special-purpose ASM simulator, to evaluate various definitions proposed in the literature for the critical OR-join construct of BPMN. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Abstract State machines; And verifications; Binding contracts; Business Process Modeling notations; Business processes; Do-mains; Domain experts; Expressive powers; Interaction patterns; True concurrencies; Visual graphs; Workflows; Abstracting; Contour followers; Decentralized control; Flow interactions; Intrusion detection; Web services; World Wide Web; Process engineering,,,,,,,"Barros, Alistair P., Service interaction patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3649, pp. 302-318, (2005); Altenhofen, Michael, A high-level specification for virtual providers, International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management, 1, 4, pp. 267-278, (2006); Altenhofen, Michael, A high-level specification for mediators (Virtual Providers), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3812 LNCS, pp. 116-129, (2005); Altenhofen, Michael, ASMs in service oriented architectures, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 14, 12, pp. 2034-2058, (2008); Barros, Alistair P., A compositional framework for service interaction patterns and interaction flows, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3785 LNCS, pp. 5-35, (2005); undefined, (2008); ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, (1992); Börger, Egon, The ASM Refinement Method, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 2-3, pp. 237-257, (2003); Börger, Egon, Construction and analysis of ground models and their refinements as a foundation for validating computer-based systems, Formal Aspects of Computing, 19, 2, pp. 225-241, (2007); Börger, Egon, Modeling workflow patterns from first principles, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4801 LNCS, pp. 1-20, (2007)","E.

Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant financial losses. This paper introduces a method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The approach models a smart contract as an Abstract State Machine (ASM), where the absence of specific vulnerabilities is encoded as invariants. An existing symbolic execution technique for ASM models was extended and improved to enable the processing of the ASM models of the smart contracts. By symbolically executing the ASM, the method identifies faulty execution paths that violate these invariants, exposing potential vulnerabilities in the contract’s behavior. Vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart contract can be generated using the symbolic execution results. As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running case study, the Auction smart contract. Furthermore, we discuss the results of applying the technique to a number of Solidity smart contracts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.",Abstract State Machines; Blockchain; Ethereum; Smart contract vulnerabilities; Solidity; Symbolic execution,Damage detection; Loss prevention; Network security; Smart contract; Abstract state machines; Block-chain; Catastrophic event; Financial loss; Model executions; Smart contract vulnerability; Solidity; State machine models; Symbolic execution; Symbolic modeling; Blockchain; Ethereum,,,,,"European Commission, EU",This work was partially supported by project SERICS (PE00000014) under the MUR National Recovery and Resilience Plan funded by the European Union-NextGenera-tionEU.,"undefined; Lncs; undefined; Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Bartoletti, Massimo, Towards Benchmarking of Solidity Verification Tools, OpenAccess Series in Informatics, 118, (2024); Formal Methods, (2025); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Braghin, Chiara, Designing Smart-Contract Based Auctions, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 895, pp. 54-64, (2020); Braghin, Chiara, An ASM-Based Approach for Security Assessment of Ethereum Smart Contracts, Proceedings of the International Conference on Security and Cryptography, pp. 334-344, (2024)","E.

Unsecured use of connected devices can cause threats or damages to the users, so security assurance, which can be ensured by the use of formal methods, must be guaranteed. Unfortunately practical usage of formal methods during the protocol design is very limited or missing at all. To address the problem of providing the designer with a user-friendly but rigorous design approach based on the use of formal methods, supporting security assurance already at the model level, but hiding the complexity of formal notations and verification techniques, in this paper we propose an approach, based on the Abstract State Machine formal method, for the specification and verification of security protocols. Specifically, we introduce a set of built-in primitives to model communication protocols and their security properties. Security verification can be carried out under the hypothesis of either a passive or an active attacker. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of its application to the Z-Wave protocol, claimed to be one of the most secure protocol for IoT devices communication thanks to the addition of the S2 Security class. We show the formal specification of the Z-Wave protocol and the security verification process. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Abstract state machines; ASMETA; Formal verification; IoT security; MITM; Z-Wave protocol,Alarm systems; Formal specification; Gas detectors; Internet of things; Network security; Abstract state machines; ASMETA; Communications protocols; Internet of thing security; MITM; Model based approach; Security assurance; Security protocols; Security verification; Z-wave protocol; Formal verification,,,,,,"☆This work is dedicated to the memory of Alessandro Bianchi who passed away in 2019.

However, formal verification, and in general the use of formal methods, is slowed by myths and misconceptions, mainly due to their mathematical base, which discourages many designers or engineers from their adoption. In this paper, we pose the basis for the long-term development of an ASM-based user-friendly framework for the formal verification of security protocols. We introduce a mathematical-based set of templates to formalise common patterns in security protocols and a set of security properties. These templates facilitate the protocol formal verification by providing built-in functions and domains, as well as transition rules and property schema, to be customised according to the specific protocol to be verified. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of their application to a number of well-known cryptographic security protocols. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Abstract state machines; Cryptographic protocols; Security assurance,Network security; Automated formal verification; Built-in functions; Cryptographic security; Formal Verification of Security; Long-term development; Security assurance; Security properties; Security protocols; Formal verification,,,,,"Science for Equity, Empowerment and Development Division, सीईईडी",The work was partially supported by the SEED Project SENTINEL.,"Analysing Safety Critical Systems and Security Protocols with Abstract State Machines, (2019); ter Beek, Maurice H., Adopting formal methods in an industrial setting: The railways case, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11800 LNCS, pp. 762-772, (2019); Arcaini, Paolo, Rigorous development process of a safety-critical system: from ASM models to Java code, International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, 19, 2, pp. 247-269, (2017); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Iiv an Invisible Invariant Verifier; undefined; Bella, Giampaolo, Formal analysis of the kerberos authentication system, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 3, 12, pp. 1337-1381, (1997); Henda, Noomene Ben, Generic and efficient attacker models in SPIN, pp. 77-86, (2014); undefined; Texts in Theoretical Computer Science, (2004)","E.

The nature of this process is highly structured and allows researchers to anticipate likely concentrations for a variety of regular, daily activities, including criminal offences. This chapter sets out to model and test these theoretical principles. Mastermind represents an interdisciplinary research project in computational criminology jointly managed by ICURS and the Software Technology Lab at Simon Fraser University. Using the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in combination with a multiagent based modeling paradigm, we devise a formal framework for semantic modeling and systematic integration of the theories for crime analysis and understanding crime patterns.

Constraints imposed to such systems need to be thoroughly checked in order to ensure a proper service delivery to the client. The current paper proposes a monitoring solution for large-scale distributed systems relying on abstract state machines. Data gathered from the monitoring components are used in calculating metrics and establishing a diagnosis for the system.

The role of a robust monitoring framework is to gather low-level data and assess the status of the components of the system. The framework collaborates with adapters for ensuring steady recovery plans and improving the availability of services. Monitors, as part of the system, are also affected by unavailability or random failures. In order to increase the reliability of the solution we verify the trustworthiness of the monitors and emphasize the need of redundancy. This paper introduces a formal approach for modeling and verifying a monitoring solution for Large-Scale Distributed Systems. We formalize the behavior of the monitors with the aid of Abstract State Machines and employ the ASMETA toolset for simulating and analyzing properties of the model. The tool also supports the verification process by translating a simplified version of the model to an NuSMV specification, on top of which model checking can be applied. Properties of the model are expressed with the aid of computation tree logic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Abstract state machines; Computation tree logic; Failure detection; Formal modeling; Model validation; Monitoring,Computer circuits; Forestry; Formal methods; Monitoring; Network security; Redundancy; Safety engineering; Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Computation tree logic; Failure detection; Formal model; Model validation; Model checking,,,,,,,"Arcaini, Paolo, Modeling and Analyzing MAPE-K Feedback Loops for Self-Adaptation, pp. 13-23, (2015); Arcaini, Paolo, AsmetaSMV: A way to link high-level ASM models to low-level NuSMV specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5977 LNCS, pp. 61-74, (2010); Proceedings of the Second NASA Formal Methods Symposium Nfm 2010, (2010); Arcaini, Paolo, ASM-based formal design of an adaptivity component for a Cloud system, Formal Aspects of Computing, 28, 4, pp. 567-595, (2016); Bianchi, Alessandro, An ASM-based model for grid job management, Informatica (Slovenia), 37, 3, pp. 295-306, (2013); Bolis, Francesco, Model-driven testing for web applications using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7703 LNCS, pp. 71-78, (2012); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Börger, Egon, Modeling distributed algorithms by abstract state machines compared to Petri nets, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9675, pp. 3-34, (2016); Correct Software in Web Applications and Web Services, (2015); Buga, Andreea, A formal approach for failure detection in large-scale distributed systems using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10438 LNCS, pp. 505-513, (2017)","A.

Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users' requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service and costs. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, failures and misbehavior. The role of the monitoring and adaptation components is essential in understanding failures of the system and reconfiguring it to a stable state based on the available information. We propose in this paper a distributed monitoring and adaptation solution responsible for identifying failures of the components and building recovery plans. The focus of the paper is to capture the nonfunctional and functional properties of the monitoring and adaptation layers in a formal model.

We present requirements and properties of an Abstract State Machines-based conceptual model that coordinates the multi-cloud interaction through the specification of a middleware exploiting adaptive interfaces to multiple clouds and supporting various service formats. While the multi-cloud system is running in normal mode, data about the execution will be gathered and evaluated by the monitoring component, and in case any critical situation is discovered the adaptation component is alerted.

SysML provides graphical notations capturing requirements for systems engineering. Here we present a concise conceptual model for systems engineering that is capable to capture the gist of SysML. The structural part is based on the common higher-order Entity Relationship model that is extended by continuous functions and various flow constraints. The behavioural part is then formalised by a hybrid extension of Abstract State Machines.

In fact, it is considered a character of the Latin alphabet, the letter ""R""in capital letters, or the digit ""4"", chosen because they contain all the singularities that are possible to find the other characters or figures, and applies them to a technique structural decomposition intended for training and recognition using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Of course, the same character written by different authors, or by the same author at different times, produces a different result. So, the training activities are more properly configured with an operation for classifying handwritten characters more or less similar, based on slight differences in slope of the stroke.

Today the biggest shift in mainstream design and programming is toward service-oriented applications. However, the service paradigm raises a bundle of problems that did not exist in traditional component-based development where abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity were the only main concerns. Due to their distributed, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature, service-oriented software applications require us to discover, document, and share new design patterns at the service- and architecture-level. Moreover, service-oriented applications are hard to design and validate, and demand for new foundational theories, modeling notations and analysis techniques. In line to such a vision, this article presents a framework, called SCA-PatternBox, to design and prototype service-oriented applications with design patterns. The framework relies on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) and on SCA component implementation types, such as SCA-Java, for supporting an “implementation-oriented” approach to service-oriented architecture modeling and to the definition and instantiation of design patterns. Moreover, in order to provide formally verified design patterns, SCA-PatternBox allows the formal specification and analysis of the functional behavioral aspects of a design pattern using a formal service specification language called SCA-ASM (Service Component Architecture-Abstract State Machine). As major evaluation of the framework, two case studies and lessons learned are presented. A final comparison of existing design pattern languages is also reported. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Design pattern languages; Formal pattern specification; Service Component Architectures; Service modeling and prototyping,Abstracting; Application programs; Computation theory; Computational linguistics; Design; Distributed computer systems; Formal specification; Information services; Java programming language; Modeling languages; Software architecture; Specification languages; Specifications; Component-Based Development; Design Patterns; Formal specification and analysis; Pattern specifications; Service component architecture; Service Model; Service oriented application; Service oriented computing; Service oriented architecture (SOA),,,,,,,"Thomas Erl Soa Design Patterns Prentice Hall December 31 2008; Oasis Service Component Architecture Sca; Patternbox Website; Apache Tuscany; Arcaini, Paolo, AsmetaSMV: A way to link high-level ASM models to low-level NuSMV specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5977 LNCS, pp. 61-74, (2010); Riccobene, Elvinia, A modeling and executable language for designing and prototyping service-oriented applications, pp. 4-11, (2011); Riccobene, Elvinia, A formal framework for service modeling and prototyping, Formal Aspects of Computing, 26, 6, pp. 1077-1113, (2014); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Sca Patternbox an Eclipse Based Design Pattern Editor for Service Component Architectures in Eclipse It2012 September 2021 2012 Naples Italy 2012; Scandurra, Patrizia, A practical and automated approach for engineering service-oriented applications with design patterns, pp. 684-689, (2014)","P.

In terms of model-checking, this is a complex task and may result in the well known ""state-explosion"" problem. These considerations led us to investigate a compositional verification approach which decomposes the system in accordance with its Software Architecture. The architectural decomposability theorem we defined in previous work decomposes the system into three logical layer: (i) application components, (ii) proxies and, (iii) middleware. This logical separation allows for reducing the global system validation to the verification of local behaviors. In this paper, we engineer the architectural decomposability theorem to the analysis of middleware-based applications by automatically generating the proxies needed by the components in order to properly interact with each other via the middleware. In particular, following the Model Driven Architecture approach and by making use of the Abstract State Machine formalism, we describe a set of transformation rules that allow for deriving correct proxies for using CORBA. By means of the proposed transformations, the correctness of the proxy behavioral models is guaranteed without the need to validate them with respect to the assumptions posed by the theorem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,Engineers; Mathematical models; Mathematical transformations; Middleware; Theorem proving; Abstract State Machine; Architectural decomposability theorem; Software Architecture; Software engineering,,,,,,,"Emmerich, Wolfgang, Software engineering and middleware: A roadmap, pp. 117-129, (2000); Proceedings of the 10th International Spin Workshop on Model Checking of Software Spin 03, (2003); Bradbury, Jeremy S., Evaluating and improving the automatic analysis of implicit invocation systems, Proceedings of the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 78-87, (2003); Kaveh, Nima, Validating distributed object and component designs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2804, pp. 63-91, (2003); Grümberg, Orna, Model Checking and Modular Verification, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 16, 3, pp. 843-871, (1994); Model Checking Abstraction and Compositional Verification, (1993); Model Checking, (1999); Caporuscio, Mauro, Compositional verification of middleware-based software architecture descriptions, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 26, pp. 221-230, (2004); ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, (1992); Omg Model Driven Architecture","M.

In a first stage, we employed the Plural tool, which is designed to perform lightweight verification of Java programs using a data-flow analysis (DFA) framework, to specify and verify the MTTS. We wrote the Plural specification for the MTTS based on the code developed by Novabase, its informal documentation, and our discussions with Novabase engineers, who validated our understanding of the MTTS application. The Plural specification language is based on typestates and access permissions. In a second stage, we developed the Pulse tool, which enhances the analysis performed by Plural, and used the tool on the MTTS specifications. Pulse translates Plural specifications into an abstract state-machine model that captures the semantics of all the possible concurrent programs implementing the given specifications, and uses the evmdd-smc symbolic model checker to verify the machine model. The experimental results on the MTTS specification show that the exhaustive model-checking approach scales reasonably well and is efficient at finding errors in specifications that were not previously detected with the data-flow analysis (DFA) capabilities of Plural. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we focus on multi-agent ASMs extended with the seq construct for turbo ASMs. We explain why traditional data flow analysis can not simply be applied to ASMs: data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph whereas in this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph.We revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis taking into account the specific, parallel nature of ASMs, and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. In particular, we analyze the role played by different types of terms in ASMs and deal with the problem of terms that are monitored by a given agent but controlled by another one, terms that are shared between several agents, and derived terms. We also discuss what consequences the use of the turbo ASM construct seq has on our analysis and revise the approach accordingly. Finally, we specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria for this class of ASMs and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.

Since traditional data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph, they cannot be directly applied to ASMs. In this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program's flow graph. Therefore, we revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. We also specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Abstracting; Computational grammars; Contour followers; Graph theory; Intrusion detection; Model checking; Pulsatile flow; Testing; Abstract State machines; Automatically tests; Coverage criterions; Data flows; Flow graphs; Flow of datums; Testing techniques; Data flow analysis,,,,,,,"Asmeta A Tool Set for the ASM, (2009); Black, Paul E., Mutation operators for specifications, pp. 81-88, (2000); A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Briand, Lionel C., Improving statechart testing criteria using data flow information, Proceedings - International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE, 2005, pp. 95-104, (2005); 12th International Workshop on Abstract State Machines ASM 05 March 8 11 2005 Laboratory of Algorithms Complexity and Logic University Paris 12 Val De Marne Creteil France, (2005); del Castillo, Giuseppe, The ASM workbench a tool environment for computer-aided analysis and validation of abstract state machine models tool demonstration, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2031 LNCS, pp. 578-581, (2001); del Castillo, Giuseppe, Model checking support for the ASM high-level language, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1785 LNCS, pp. 331-346, (2000); Clarke, Edmund Melson, Automatic Verification of Finite-State Concurrent Systems Using Temporal Logic Specifications, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 8, 2, pp. 244-263, (1986); Clarke, Edmund Melson, Efficient generation of counterexamples and witnesses in symbolic model checking, pp. 427-432, (1995); Clarke, Lori A., A Formal Evaluation of Data Flow Path Selection Criteria, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 15, 11, pp. 1318-1332, (1989)","A.

Nonetheless, fundamental liveness properties can still not be expressed in the new sequence diagrams. In recent work, we have proposed to solve this by enriching sequence diagrams with a simple but powerful Object Constraint Language (OCL) template for liveness. In this paper, we show how to formalize our liveness-enriched sequence diagrams using Abstract State Machines. Sequence diagrams still have several open problems. For example, the semantics of some of the newly introduced operators is ambiguous, and it is not clear how they can be used or combined with other operators. We address some of these issues in the paper. Finally, a further advantage of using ASMs as a semantic model concerns synthesis. It is our ultimate goal to be able to synthesise automatically a state-based object system from our richer sequence diagrams. ASMs are a state-based and operational formalism which therefore eases this task considerably. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,Flowcharting; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Live sequence chart; Liveness properties; Message Sequence Charts; Object Constraint Language; Object systems; Semantic Model; Sequence diagrams; Graphic methods,,,,,,,"State Machines, (2003); Bradfield, Julian C., Enriching ocl using observational mu-calculus, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2306, pp. 203-217, (2002); Cavarra, Alessandra, A method for the automatic generation of test suites from object models, Information and Software Technology, 46, 5 SPEC.

However, the description level provided by the employed formalisms is either too much 'abstract' - unable to grasp the operational behavior of the skeletons of the language - or too much 'concrete' - close to implementation details and therefore related to a particular machine model. This paper shows how the Gurevich's Abstract State Machines (ASMs) have been successfully employed to describe the parallel semantics of skeletons of P3L completely abstracting from any implementation detail.

Due to the high importance of interlocking table at the design state of a signalization system, the modelling and verification of interlocking tables are examined in this work. For this purpose, abstract state machines are used as a modelling tool. The developed models have been performed in a generalized structure such that the model control can be done automatically for the interlocking systems. In this study, NuSMV is used at the verification state. Also, the consistency of the developed models has been supervised through fault injection.

A metamodeling process facilitated by the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) tool suite enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSML-s.

In order to simplify the DSML semantics, this paper discusses semantic anchoring, which is based on the transformational specification of semantics. Using a mathematical model, Abstract State Machine (ASM), as a common semantic framework, we have developed formal operational semantics for a set of basic models of computations, called semantic units.

While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable ""semantic units"" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units.

However, there are still challenges hindering the wide-scale industrial application of model-based design. One of these unsolved problems is the lack of a practical, effective method for the formal specification of DSML semantics. This problem has negative impact on reusability of DSML-s and analysis tools in domain specific tool chains. To address these issues, we propose a formal well founded methodology with supporting tools to anchor the semantics of DSML-s to precisely defined and validated ""semantic units"". In our methodology, each of the syntactic and semantic DSML components is defined precisely and completely. The main contribution of our approach is that it moves toward an infrastructure for DSML design that integrates formal methods with practical engineering tools. In this paper we use a mathematical model, Abstract State Machines, a common semantic framework to define the semantic domains of DSML-s.

However, PReP assumes a failure free environment. Failures lead to process documentation unable to be recorded, losing the evidence that a process occurred. This is not acceptable in the applications relying on process documentation and would cause disastrous consequences.

Such a strategy is appealing to implement an intelligent machine which foresees multiple time steps instead of predicting step by step. In particular, a flexible sequential learning is developed to directly predict future states without visiting all intermediate states. A Bayesian approach to multi-temporal-difference neural network is accordingly proposed to calculate the stochastic belief state for an abstract state machine so as to capture large-span context as well as make high-level prediction. Importantly, the sequence data are represented by multiple jumpy states with varying temporal differences. A Bayesian state machine is trained by maximizing the variational lower bound of log likelihood of sequence data. A generalized sequence model with various number of Markov states is derived with the simplified realization to the previous temporal-difference variational autoencoder. The predictive states are learned to roll forward with jumps. Experiments show that this approach is substantially trained to predict jumpy states in various types of sequence data. © 2022 J.-T.

Although atomic object implementations are abundant, proving that algorithms achieve atomicity has turned out to be a challenging problem. In this paper, we initiate the study of systematic ways of verifying distributed implementations of atomic objects, beginning with read/write objects (registers). Our general approach is to replace the existing operational reasoning about events and partial orders with assertional reasoning about invariants and simulation relations. To this end, we define an abstract state machine that captures the atomicity property and prove correctness of the object implementations by establishing a simulation mapping between the implementation and the specification automata. We demonstrate the generality of our specification by showing that it is implemented by three different read/write register constructions: the message-passing register emulation of Attiya, Bar-Noy and Dolev, its optimized version based on real time, and the shared memory register construction of Vitanyi and Awerbuch. In addition, we show that a simplified version of our specification is implemented by a general atomic object construction based on the Lamport's replicated state machine algorithm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,Algorithms; Automata theory; Computer simulation; Object oriented programming; Problem solving; Real time systems; Atomic object implementations; Replicated state machine algorithm; Specification automata; Distributed computer systems,,,,,,,"Abraham, Ittai, Byzantine disk paxos: Optimal resilience with byzantine shared memory, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, 23, pp. 226-235, (2004); Archer, Myla M., TAME: Using PVS strategies for special-purpose theorem proving, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, 29, 1-4, pp. 139-181, (2000); Attiya, Hagit, Sharing Memory Robustly in Message-Passing Systems, Journal of the ACM, 42, 1, pp. 124-142, (1995); Distributed Computing Fundamentals Simulations and Advanced Topics, (1998); Formal Verification of Simulations Between I O Automata, (2000); Technical Report, (2005); Doherty, Simon, Formal verification of a practical lock-free queue algorithm, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3235, pp. 97-114, (2004); Geoquorums Implementing Atomic Memory in Ad Hoc Networks, (2006); Fekete, Alan D., Eventually-serializable data services, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, pp. 300-309, (1996); Herlihy, Maurice P., Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 12, 3, pp. 463-492, (1990)","G.

A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the ""everything is a model"" principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or WebML. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We define refinements following the semantical framework of observability, however, with respect to chosen pieces of the program. The time we consider is continuous as our motivation is related to systems of control that are usually specified within continuous time framework; the same framework is valid for discrete time. We remark that refinement of timed programs is not a simple replacement of a part of a program by making it more detailed. As an example to illustrate this we take Lamport's Bakery Algorithm with real-time constraints. However, one of the key questions related to the verification of refinements is the preservation of verification proofs for the non refined initial algorithm as much as possible when verifying the refinement. This is the case for the notion of refinement we define. We introduce a notion of asynchronous timed distributed algorithm, define its semantics and discuss in what logic can be expressed its functioning. Then we introduce notions of refinement, and consider a refinement of interprocess communication of real-time Lamport's Bakery algorithm using parallel message exchange. Such a refinement, contrary to our intuition, demands some non evident transformation of the initial algorithm to make it correct. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,Continuous time systems; Discrete time control systems; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Asynchronous algorithms; Bakery algorithm; Discrete time; Interprocess communication; Message exchange; Real time constraints; Continuous-time; Algorithms,,,,,,,"Existence of Refinement Mappings, (1988); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Broy, Manfred Hans Bertold, Compositional refinement of interactive systems, Journal of the ACM, 44, 6, pp. 850-891, (1997); J of Pure and Applied Logic, (1999); Proc of the Intern Workshop on Abstract State Machines ASM 2000, (2000); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Lamport, Leslie, A New Solution of Dijkstra's Concurrent Programming Problem, Communications of the ACM, 17, 8, pp. 453-455, (1974); Ostroff, Jonathan S., Composition and refinement of discrete real-time systems, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 8, 1, pp. 1-48, (1999); Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science, (1990)",,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,Blue Capital Inc.; Microsoft Research; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),"International Workshop on Abstract State Machines: Theory and Applications, ASM 2000",,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

However, its lack of rigor and formal semantics prevents it further development. This paper extends UML activity diagrams with timing constraints for modeling real-time systems, and gives a formal description of UML activity diagrams based on Petri Net. Authors' work can be a basis of checking UML activity diagram models. Authors develop the algorithms for analyzing the real-time properties of activity diagram using integer time verification technology. UML activity diagrams are similar to Petri nets, However, in view of describing timed program behavior, authors put the constraints on activity states instead of on transitions in Petri Net.",Activity diagram; Formal Semantics; Petri net; Real-time system; Unified Modeling Language (UML),Computer programming languages; Petri nets; Semantics; Abstract state machine; Activity diagram; Finite state process; Subactivity state; Unified modeling language; Real time systems,,,,,,,"Real Time Uml Developing Efficient Objects for Embedded Systems, (1998); Unified Modeling Language User Guide, (1999); Li, Xuandong, Checking time Petri nets for linear duration properties, pp. 218-227, (1999); undefined, (2000); Börger, Egon, An ASM semantics for UML activity diagrams, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1816, pp. 293-308, (2000); Proc of the 3rd Intl Conf on the Unified Modeling Language, (2000); Proceedings of OOPSLA 98 Workshop on Formalizing Uml, (1998); Unified Modeling Language Specification Version 1 3, (1999); Xuandong, Liu, Timing analysis of UML activity diagrams, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2185, pp. 62-75, (2001); Formal Semantics of Computer Language, (1992)","M.

This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Those aspect-oriented specifications often can be more easily reused than extensions that are implemented directly into an existing specification. Another use case is the extension of a specification with new functionality or features. Although this would be possible with refinement too, with aspect-orientation it is not necessary to augment the original specification with “extension points” that can be used for refinement. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect-oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented according to an aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail. The applicability of aspect-oriented specification in the context of ASM is demonstrated by means of examples, e.g. implementing a fading aspect into the light control system specification of a former ASM case study.

Aiming at the development of a comprehensive EA-based specification and design environment, we introduce the concept of an evolving algebra abstract machine (EAM) as a platform for the systematic development of EA tools; for instance, as required for machine based analysis and execution of EA specifications. We give a formal definition of the EAM ground model in terms of a universal evolving algebra, where we validate the correctness of the relation between evolving algebras (their theoretical foundations) and their EAM representation and interpretation. Our approach covers sequential as well as distributed evolving algebras. © 1996, Springer-Verlag.

We propose a methodology based on the construction of a mathematical model which reflects the given system so closely that the correctness can be established by observation and experimentation (ground model). Complex technical systems are often heterogeneous, so that different system aspects are best modelled by means of different techniques. This leads to heterogeneous ground models. To achieve a consistent and coherent view of hetero- geneous behavioural models, which is a prerequisite for any systematic analysis and validation, we introduce a common semantic framework (meta-model) based on the notion of Abstract State Machines.

Competitors write programs for agents, which are supposed to complete a given task or fight against other agents. In order to achieve the best performance, programs may have to use advanced Artificial Intelligence methods. In this paper, we present a framework to build artificial intelligence games, using Abstract State Machines (ASM) for the specification of the rules of the games. Choosing ASM, we expect that the competitors will be able to understand clearly the semantics of the rules. The framework includes a compiler for an ASM-based language, allows complete control of the order of execution of agents and easy integration with graphical libraries. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Web application development there-fore has potentially the most to gain from adopting such techniques that can offer a greater return on development time and quality factors than traditional approaches.

The distributed virtual machines must be scalable, have to allow parallel processing, have to be fault-tolerant, and should have the potential to work in real time.

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of a (self-stabilizing) infrastructure such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system for their execution. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this article, we present our design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler. The compiler we designed and implemented transforms programs written in a language similar to the abstract state machine (ASM).

A system is considered self-stabilizing if, starting in any state, it converges to the desired behavior. Self-stabilizing algorithms were designed for solving fundamental distributed tasks, such as leader election, token circulation and communication network protocols. The algorithms were expressed using guarded commands or pseudo-code. The realization of these algorithms requires the existence of (self-stabilizing) infrastructure for their execution such as a self-stabilizing microprocessor and a self-stabilizing operating system. Moreover, the high-level description of the algorithms needs to be converted into machine language of the microprocessor. In this work, we present a design for a self-stabilization preserving compiler designed for programs written in a language similar to the abstract state machine (ASM). The compiler preserves the stabilization property of the high level program. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Fault tolerant computer systems; Formal languages; Microprocessor chips; Telecommunication networks; Abstract state machine (ASM); Self-stabilizing algorithms; Token circulation; Program compilers,,,,,,,"Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Brukman, Olga, Self-stabilizing autonomic recoverer for eventual Byzantine software, pp. 20-29, (2003); Workshop on Adaptive Distributed Systems Wadisos, (2003); Dijkstra, Edsger W., Self-stabilizing systems in spite of distributed control, Communications of the ACM, 17, 11, pp. 643-644, (1974); Self Stabilization, (2000); 17th International Conference on Architecture of Computing Systems, (2004); IEEE Transaction on Computers, (2006); Technical Report 2005 06, (2005); Dolev, Shlomi, Self-stabilization of dynamic systems assuming only read/write atomicity, Distributed Computing, 7, 1, pp. 3-16, (1993)","S.

IRS-III is a framework and platform for developing WSMO based semantic web services. Our choreography framework is based on the KADS system-client co-operation model that represents communication through two dimensions: the message direction and which actor has the initiative. Our formalism is state based and is thus compliant with Abstract State Machine (ASM) model used within WSMO. In addition to describing our approach in this paper we provide a formal semantics for IRS Choreography and a full implementation which we illustrate through an example application. © 2006 IEEE.,,Abstract State Machine (ASM) models; Choreography; Message direction; Web services; Communication; Electronic mail; Gesture recognition; Mathematical models; Semantics; World Wide Web; Information services,,,,,,,"undefined, (2005); Proceedings of the International Workshop on Current Trends in Applied Formal Method Applied Formal Methods, (1998); Crubézy, Monica, Configuring Online Problem-Solving Resources with the Internet Reasoning Service, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 18, 2, pp. 34-42, (2003); Dijkman, Remco M., Service-oriented design: A multi-viewpoint approach, International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems, 13, 4, pp. 337-368, (2004); Dip Project, (2005); Proceedings of the Workshop on Wsmo Implementations Wiw 2004, (2004); Looking Toward the Next Phase for Web Services, (2002); Fensel, Dieter, The web service modeling framework WSMF, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 1, 2, pp. 113-137, (2002); Fensel, Dieter, Structured development of problem solving methods, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 13, 6, pp. 913-932, (2001); Proceedings of the Workshop on Wsmo Implementations Wiw 2004 Frankfurt Germany, (2004)","J.

Main features of the model include usage of timestamps, flattening, unified and independent behaviour of function block interfaces. This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language.

This problem is known to be an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary multiobjective algorithms are optimization methods to solve such problems. hypervolume is one of the most important criteria that is used to both as solution evaluation and as a guidance for near-optimal selection of a set of solutions called the Pareto front. In this paper, a new hypervolume-based multiobjective algorithm is proposed for driving the Pareto front. To this end, we extend the single-objective Black hole heuristic algorithm based on the adopted θ-dominance relation to improving the diversity and convergence to an optimal Pareto front. The conflicting objectives are resource utilization, resource cost, and the workflow makespan (completion time). Also to presenting the appropriate scheduling algorithm, we have proven the correctness of the proposed algorithm by providing the behavioral model of the suggested system using model checking tool. For this purpose, we first introduce the behavioral model of the proposed system using Abstract state machine and extract the properties of the algorithm in the form of linear temporal logic. Then we encode the algorithm using the model checker tool Abstract state Machine Meta-model-based Language and verify the accuracy of the algorithm based on the expected properties, reachability, fairness, and deadlock-free. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we: (1) extended the WorkflowSim tools, (2) applied it to both balanced and imbalanced workflows and (3) compared results to algorithms, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm-2, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-2, Multi-Swarm MultiObjective Optimization, Intelligent Water Drops algorithm and Genetic Algorithm and Pareto-based Grey Wolf Optimizer. The comparisons show that by increasing the number of users requests and their correlations, the proposed algorithm can find more optimal Pareto front. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Black hole algorithm; Hypervolume; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto front; Workflow scheduling,Behavioral research; Cloud computing; Genetic algorithms; Gravitation; Heuristic algorithms; Model checking; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; NP-hard; Scheduling; Stars; Virtual machine; Black holes; Evolutionary multi-objective algorithms; Hypervolume; Intelligent water drops algorithms; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Pareto front; Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm; Workflow scheduling; Scheduling algorithms,,,,,"University of Kashan, (231432)",Authors would like to thank University of Kashan for supporting this research under Grant #231432.,"Computers and Intractability A Guide to the Theory of Np Completeness, (1979); Fleischer, Mark A., The measure of Pareto optima applications to multi-objective metaheuristics, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2632, pp. 519-533, (2003); Zitzler, Eckart, Indicator-based selection in multiobjective search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3242, pp. 832-842, (2004); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Igel, Christian, Covariance matrix adaptation for multi-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 15, 1, pp. 1-28, (2007); Ebadifard, Fatemeh, Optimizing multi objective based workflow scheduling in cloud computing using black hole algorithm, pp. 102-108, (2017); Hatamlou, Abdolreza R., Black hole: A new heuristic optimization approach for data clustering, Information Sciences, 222, pp. 175-184, (2013); Workflowsim A Toolkit for Simulating Scientific Workflows in Distributed Environments, (2012); Calheiros, Rodrigo Neves, CloudSim: A toolkit for modeling and simulation of cloud computing environments and evaluation of resource provisioning algorithms, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 1, pp. 23-50, (2011); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization, (2002)","S.M.

This will increase the satisfaction of customers due to providing their QoS requirements. The available solutions to this problem often seek to improve one of the criteria for service quality and use different methods to achieve this goal. This paper is aimed at offering an optimal solution to solve the task scheduling problem in the cloud environment using the firefly algorithm. The proposed algorithm helps not only to reduce the longest task completion time, but also to increase the utilization of virtual machines by taking into account the capabilities of each virtual machine and using the appropriate method for distributing virtual machine requests. Although, finding a proper task scheduling method is desirable, the correctness of this approach that can be checked by the automatic formal verification methods is a challenge. One of the most efficient method in this area is model checking which can verify the behavior of a system by checking some desired properties on the system model. Hence, we define a behavioral model of the task scheduling algorithm based on model checking techniques. To do so, we encode the algorithm to Abstract State Machine Metamodel-based Language (AsmetaL) and then some properties are defined for verifying the algorithm. The results obtained from the implementation of the proposed method show that the proposed method has an acceptable improvement for makespan and resource utilization. © 2018 IEEE.",ASM; Cloud Computing; Firefly Algorithm; Formal Verification; Model Checking; Task Scheduling,Bioluminescence; Cloud computing; Customer satisfaction; Formal verification; Multitasking; Network security; Optimization; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Virtual machine; ASM; Cloud computing environments; Cloud environments; Cloud-computing; Firefly algorithms; Models checking; Property; Simulation analysis; Task-scheduling algorithms; Tasks scheduling; Model checking,,,,,,,"Proceedings of the International Conference for Young Researchers in Informatics Mathematics and Engineering Kaunas, (2017); Ebadifard, Fatemeh, A PSO‐based task scheduling algorithm improved using a load-balancing technique for the cloud computing environment, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 30, 12, (2018); Nature Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms, (2008); Arcaini, Paolo, AsmetaSMV: A way to link high-level ASM models to low-level NuSMV specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5977 LNCS, pp. 61-74, (2010); Rafe, Vahid, ASM2Bogor: An approach for verification of models specified through Asmeta language, Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, 23, 5, pp. 287-298, (2012); Ebadifard, Fatemeh, A modified black hole-based multi-objective workflow scheduling improved using the priority queues for cloud computing environment, pp. 162-167, (2018); Wang, Lin, Task scheduling policy based on ant colony optimization in cloud computing environment, pp. 953-957, (2013); Dhinesh Babu, L.

To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of the loop, break and strict operators in sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and their related constraints. © 2013 IEEE.",Abstract state machines; Distributed systems; Embedded software; Formal methods; Sequence diagrams; UML,Embedded software; Formal methods; Open systems; Semantics; Specifications; Unified Modeling Language; Abstract state machines; Distributed systems; Formal Semantics; Modeling tool; Operational semantics; Parallel environment; Sequence diagrams; UML; Graphic methods,,,,,,,"Omg Unified Modeling Language Uml Specification V2 4 1, (2011); Uml 2 0 Sequence Diagrams Semantics, (2008); Micskei, Zoltán, The many meanings of UML 2 Sequence Diagrams: A survey, Software and Systems Modeling, 10, 4, pp. 489-514, (2011); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995)",,,IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org,,"2013 IEEE Conference on Open Systems, ICOS 2013",,,,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"IEEE Conf.

These fragments are based on a set of operators that can simplify the diagram's structure or alter the order of events in the diagram. Unfortunately, the new revision introduced a significant degree of ambiguity in the interpretation of these diagrams. This ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that different styles of sequence diagrams can be used for different purposes of modeling and analysis. To address this ambiguity, this paper presents a formal model in operational semantics based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) to define the semantics of sequence diagrams. Specifically, update rules are devised for ASMs to handle important behaviors present in most embedded software operating in distributed or parallel environments. The approach in this paper assumes that lifeline processes in a sequence diagram act as autonomous agents that communicate by exchanging messages among each other in asynchronous and distributed manner. This formal model can be readily extended to define the semantics of the remaining operators including information about time intervals and constraints. © 2013 ACM.",abstract state machines; sequence diagrams; uml,Autonomous agents; Embedded software; Information technology; Semantics; Unified Modeling Language; Abstract state machines; Formal model; Model and analysis; Operational semantics; Parallel environment; Sequence diagrams; Time interval; uml; Graphic methods,,,,,,,"Omg Unified Modeling Language Uml Specification V2 4 1, (2011); Uml 2 0 Sequence Diagrams Semantics, (2008); Micskei, Zoltán, The many meanings of UML 2 Sequence Diagrams: A survey, Software and Systems Modeling, 10, 4, pp. 489-514, (2011); Störrle, Harald, Semantics of interactions in UML 2.0, pp. 129-136, (2003); Critical Systems Development with Uml Proc Csduml 04, (2004); Küster-Filipe, Juliana, Modelling concurrent interactions, Theoretical Computer Science, 351, 2, pp. 203-220, (2006); Fernandes, João M., Designing tool support for translating use cases and UML 2.0 sequence diagrams into a coloured petri net, pp. 2-11, (2007); Eichner, Christoph, Compositional semantics for UML 2.0 sequence diagrams using Petri nets, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3530, pp. 133-148, (2005); Shen, Hui, Formal analysis of Sequence Diagram with Combined Fragments, pp. 44-54, (2012); Knapp, Alexander, Model checking of UML 2.0 interactions, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4364 LNCS, pp. 42-51, (2007)",,,Association for Computing Machinery acmhelpacm.org,Special Interest Group for Information Technology Education (ACM SIGITE),"2nd Annual Conference on Research in Information Technology, RIIT 2013",,,,,9.78145E+12,,,English,RIIT - Proc.

However, at the same time, it is also a classic BPM domain concerned with typical aspects like creation and exchange of diagrammatic process models, elicitation of domain knowledge, and implementing process (models) into organisations and IT systems. Nevertheless, the Abstract State Machine (ASM) concept, a formal and abstract specification means for algorithms, has been and is fundamental and an important cornerstone for the S-BPM community. The first formal specifications for S-BPM has been developed by Egon Börger using ASM means—namely a specification for an interpreter engine for the subject-oriented modeling language PASS, the Parallel Activity Specification Schema. However, for the sake of intuitive and comprehensive use, ASM can be enriched with defining the passive aspects of PASS, namely the (data) structure of process models and data object appearing in the processes. Here it is useful to complement ASM description means with concepts that are better suited for that tasks. This work analyzes how the S-BPM research community has combined ASM with the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to generate a precise, while comprehensible, system specification for the execution of formal, subject-oriented process models. Furthermore, it will be argued why this combination is worthwhile overcoming the weaknesses of both generic and technology independent specification approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",ASM; Formal standards; OWL; PASS; S-BPM; Subject-orientation,Birds; Enterprise resource management; Knowledge management; Modeling languages; Ontology; Specification languages; Abstract specifications; Abstract state machines; Business process management; Research communities; Subject-oriented modeling; System specification; Technology independent; Web ontology language; Formal specification,,,,,,,"undefined; Luhmann Leicht Gemacht, (2011); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Subjektorientiertes Prozessmanagement, (2011); Handbook of Conceptual Modeling Theory Practice and Research Challenges, (2011); undefined; Coreasm an Extensible Modeling Framework Tool Environment for High Level Design and Analysis of Distributed Systems, (2009); S Bpm One 2019 11th International Conference on Subject Oriented Business Process Management Icpc Published by ACM Digital Library Association of Computing Machinery, (2019); Fleischmann, Albert, Subject-oriented business process management, pp. 1-375, (2012); Requirements Engineering, (2004)","C.

SDL is a fairly complex, graphical formal description technique for the development of distributed systems, and has been broadly used in industry for many years. Efforts to define the semantics of SDL-2000 formally have started early in 199 8. Bynow, a draft formal semantics is available, which is determined to become the oficial formal SDL semantics after its approval in 2000. It is based on the formalism of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which has been selected for several reasons including intelligibility and executability. The formal semantics of SDL addresses the static semantics, transformation rules, and the dynamic semantics. The approach taken to define the dynamic semantics is particularly interesting. Although basically being operational, it differs from existing approaches in several ways. In this paper, we address and highlight some of these differences, using a simplified specification language called SSL instead of SDL. In defining a formal dynamic semantics for SSL, we formally describe an abstract machine, a compilation function mapping SSL specifications to code of this machine, and an operational definition of the set of initial states, using ASM as the underlying formalism. Furthermore, we present in some detail the semantics of SSL procedure calls. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,Specification languages; Specifications; Computational linguistics; Semantics; Abstract machines; Abstract state machines; Distributed systems; Formal description techniques; International standardization; Operational definition; Specification and description languages; Transformation rules; Function mapping; Formal methods,,,,,,,"Technical Report Unu Iist Report no 68, (1996); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999); Formal Syntax and Semantics of Java, (1998); Broy, Manfred Hans Bertold, Towards a formal foundation of the specification and description language SDL, Formal Aspects of Computing, 3, 1, pp. 21-57, (1991); Design of Distributed Systems an Introduction to Focus, (1993); Sdl Formal Object Oriented Language for Communicating Systems, (1997); Local Proc of Asm2000, (2000); Proc of the Workshop on Petri Nets and Protocols of the 16th Intern Conf on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets, (1995); Analysis and Formal Verification of Sdl 92 Specifications Using Extended Petri Nets, (1995); ASM Semantics of Sdl Concepts Methods Tools, (1998)",,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,Blue Capital Inc.; Microsoft Research; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),"International Workshop on Abstract State Machines: Theory and Applications, ASM 2000",,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

The importance and acceptance of SDL in the telecommunication industry surpasses that of UML, which can be seen as the major competitor. A crucial difference between SDL and UML is the existence of a formal SDL semantics as part of the international standard, which has a positive impact on the quality of the entire language definition. In this paper, we treat fundamental questions concerning practicability, adequacy and maintainability of the formalization approach, provide insights into the formal semantics definition and point out several effects on the SDL standard. © Springer Pub.

However the reactive approaches are usually tightly coupled to a particular embodiment making transfer of knowledge difficult. This paper proposes a paradigm for modeling and execution of reactive manipulation actions, which makes knowledge transfer to different embodiments possible while retaining the reactive capabilities of the embodiments. The proposed approach extends the idea of control primitives coordinated by a state machine by introducing an embodiment independent layer of abstraction. Abstract manipulation primitives constitute a vocabulary of atomic, embodiment independent actions, which can be coordinated using state machines to describe complex actions. To obtain embodiment specific models, the abstract state machines are automatically translated to embodiment specific models, such that full capabilities of each platform can be utilized. The strength of the manipulation primitives paradigm is demonstrated by developing a set of corresponding embodiment specific primitives for object transport, including a complex reactive grasping primitive. The robustness of the approach is experimentally studied in emptying of a box filled with several unknown objects. The embodiment independence is studied by performing a manipulation task on two different platforms using the same abstract description. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The proof is based on a fixed point technique in lambda calculus and on Gurevich sequential Thesis which allows to identify sequential deterministic algorithms with Abstract State Machines. This extends to algorithms for partial computable functions in such a way that finite computations ending with exceptions are associated to finite reductions leading to terms with a particular very simple feature. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",ASM; lambda calculus; operational semantics; theory of algorithms,Abstract state machines; ASM; Computable functions; Computation model; Computation steps; Data type; Deterministic algorithms; Finite computations; Fixed points; Lambda calculus; Natural extension; Operational semantics; Step-by-step; theory of algorithms; Calculations; Computational mechanics; Computer science; Differentiation (calculus); Technical presentations; Algorithms,,,,,,,"Atrubin, A.

In a communication phase initiated by all programs having reached the barrier only messages between the programs are exchanged until normal processing can be continued.

We present a prototype of an implementation of this phase which transforms Java code into base-level ASM specifications. The second phase consists in incrementally applying sound semi-automated abstraction procedures for ASMs to derive higher-level specifications, starting from the base-level ASM specification obtained in the first phase.

Recently, it was shown that non-deterministic database transformations can be captured exactly by a variant of ASMs, the so-called Database Abstract State Machines (DB-ASMs). In this article we present a logic for DB-ASMs, extending the logic of Nanchen and Stärk for ASMs. In particular, we develop a rigorous proof system for the logic for DB-ASMs, which is proven to be sound and complete. The most difficult challenge to be handled by the extension is a proper formalization capturing non-determinism of database transformations and all its related features such as consistency, update sets or multisets associated with DB-ASM rules. As the database part of a state of database transformations is a finite structure and DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers only over the database part of a state, we resolve this problem by taking update sets explicitly into the logic, i.e. by using an additional modal operator [X ], where X is interpreted as an update set Δ generated by a DB-ASM rule. The DB-ASM logic provides a powerful verification tool to study properties of database transformations. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. In addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first-order structures. The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every other tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Abstract state machine; ASM thesis; Behavioural theory; Parallel algorithm,Computation theory; Parallel algorithms; Abstract machines; Abstract state machines; ASM thesis; Axiomatization; Behavioural theory; Finite model theory; Ground terms; Sequential algorithm; Abstracting,,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P26452-N15); Austrian Science Fund, FWF; Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT; Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft, BMWFW, (844597)","The research reported in this paper results from the project Behavioural Theory and Logics for Distributed Adaptive Systems supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): [ P26452-N15 ] .

System states keep the runtime information relevant for the evaluation of OCL expressions. However, not all new language concepts of OCL 2.0 are already addressed in that formal semantics. We show how to overcome this by introducing new components to the object model and system states defining a dynamic semantics of OCL. In order to give precise rules that determine when the current system state has to be updated according to a change in the referred UML model, we make use of adequate mathematical means, namely Abstract State Machines (ASMs).

The two identical agents start from arbitrary nodes in the graph and move from node to node with the goal of meeting. In this paper, we focus on rendezvous in trees, and, analogously to the efforts that have been made for solving the exploration problem with compact automata, we study the size of memory of mobile agents that permits to solve the rendezvous problem deterministically. Werst show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents is arbitrary, then the lower bound on memory required for rendezvous is Ω (log n) bits, even for the line of length n. This lower bound meets a previously known upper bound of O(log n) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary trees of size at most n. Our main result is a proof that the amount of memory needed for rendezvous with simultaneous start depends essentially on the number ℓ of leaves of the tree, and is exponentially less impacted by the number n of nodes. Indeed, we present two identical agents with O(log ℓ+log log n) bits of memory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at most n nodes and at most ℓ leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many leaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for rendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with delay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that Ω (log ℓ + log log n) bits of memory is required for rendezvous, even in the class of trees with degrees bounded by 3.",Abstract state machine; Exploration; Mobile entities; Rendezvous; Robots,Abstract state machines; Arbitrary delays; Connected graph; Exploration; Lower bounds; Memory size; Mobile entities; Upper Bound; Abstracting; Contour followers; Graph theory; Robots; Mobile agents,,,,,,,"Alpern, Steve, Rendezvous search problem, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 33, 3, pp. 673-683, (1995); Alpern, Steve, Rendezvous search on labeled networks, Naval Research Logistics, 49, 3, pp. 256-274, (2002); Theory of Search Games and Rendezvous, (2003); Alpern, Steve, Rendezvous search on a graph, Journal of Applied Probability, 36, 1, pp. 223-231, (1999); Journal of Applied Probability, (1990); Anderson, Edward James, Asymmetric rendezvous on the plane, Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, pp. 365-373, (1998); Anderson, Edward James, Two dimensional rendezvous search, Operations Research, 49, 1, pp. 107-118, (2001); Baston, Victor J.D., Rendezvous on the line when the players' initial distance IS given by an unknown probability distribution, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 36, 6, pp. 1880-1889, (1998); Baston, Victor J.D., Rendezvous search when marks are left at the starting points, Naval Research Logistics, 48, 8, pp. 722-731, (2001); SIAM J Comput, (1980)","P.

The rendezvous problem is unsolvable in the class of arbitrary connected graphs, as witnessed by the example of the cycle. Hence we restrict attention to rendezvous in trees, where rendezvous is feasible if and only if the initial positions of the agents are not symmetric. We prove that the minimum memory size guaranteeing rendezvous in all trees of size at most n is Θ(log n) bits. The upper bound is provided by an algorithm for abstract state machines accomplishing rendezvous in all trees, and using O(log n) bits of memory in trees of size at most n. The lower bound is a consequence of the need to distinguish between up to n∈-∈1 links incident to a node. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we focus on the potential existence of pairs of finite agents (i.e., finite automata) capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees. We show that, as opposed to what has been proved for the graph exploration problem, there are no finite agents capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Abstract State machines; Bounded degree trees; Connected graphs; Graph explorations; In trees; Initial positions; Lower bounds; Memory sizes; Upper bounds; Computational geometry; Control theory; Finite automata; Graph theory; Mobile agents; Problem solving; Trees (mathematics),,,,,,,"Aleliunas, Romas, Random walks, universal traversal sequences, and the complexity of maze problems, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, pp. 218-223, (1979); Alpern, Steve, Rendezvous search problem, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 33, 3, pp. 673-683, (1995); Alpern, Steve, Rendezvous search on labeled networks, Naval Research Logistics, 49, 3, pp. 256-274, (2002); Theory of Search Games and Rendezvous, (2003); Alpern, Steve, Rendezvous search on a graph, Journal of Applied Probability, 36, 1, pp. 223-231, (1999); SIAM J Control Optim, (1995); Journal of Applied Probability, (1990); SIAM J Control Optim, (1995); Anderson, Edward James, Asymmetric rendezvous on the plane, Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, pp. 365-373, (1998); Anderson, Edward James, Two dimensional rendezvous search, Operations Research, 49, 1, pp. 107-118, (2001)",,,,CNRS; INRIA; LaBRI; ENSERB; ASR,"22nd International Symposium on Distributed Computing, DISC 2008",,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

The composition of multiple parties’ business processes is always done with a specific objective in mind. Not only in the positive case, but also if the objective of a business process can not be fulfilled, all participating business processes need to be in some expected recovery state. We propose a composition algorithm solving the task of designing a collaborative business process while respecting a set of primary and recovery goals. In our model, each business process is described as a finite state machine. The multiplication of all business processes in one single model of possible executions would lead to an explosion of the number of states. Therefore, our composition algorithm directly interprets the multiple finite state machine (FSM) representations and creates a collaborative business process without integrating all FSMs into one single FSM upfront. Our composition algorithm returns an orchestration of the given business processes only in the case that it can be assured that each execution only leads to an expected primary or recovery goal. In order to prove our concepts, we first mathematically define the execution of business processes and orchestrations by providing abstract state machine (ASM) representations for them. Second, we execute the ASMs in the execution engine CoreASM which shows that the generated orchestration steers the execution of the business processes as intended. © 2007 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

Turbo ASMs are viewed as black-boxes that can combine arbitrary many steps of one or more submachines into one big step. The intermediate steps of a turbo ASM are not observable from outside. It is not even clear what exactly the intermediate steps are, because the semantics of turbo ASMs is usually defined inductively along the call graph of the ASM and the structure of the rule bodies. The most important application of turbo ASMs are recursive algorithms. Such algorithms can directly be simulated on turbo ASMs without transforming them into multi-agent (distributed) ASMs. In this article we analyze the hidden intermediate steps of turbo ASMs and characterize them using PAR/SEQ trees. We also address the problem of the reserve in the presence of recursion and sequential composition.

We report some experimental results which validate the method, compare the fault adequacy criteria with some classical structural coverage criteria and show an empirical cross coverage among faults. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",Abstract state machines; Fault based testing; Model based testing; Test,Abstracting; Specifications; Abstract state machines; Detection condition; Fault based testing; Model based testing; Fault detection,,,,,,,"Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, (1959); Model Checkers in Software Testing, (2002); Ammann, Paul E., Using model checking to generate tests from specifications, 1998-December, pp. 46-54, (1998); Ammann, Paul E., A specification-based coverage metric to evaluate test sets, International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 275-299, (2001); Atlee, Joanne M., A logic-model semantics for SCR software requirements, pp. 280-292, (1996); Barnett, Mike, The ABCs of specification: Asml, behavior, and components, Informatica (Slovenia), 25, 4, pp. 517-526, (2001); Beyer, Dirk, Generating tests from counterexamples, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 26, pp. 326-335, (2004); Mutation Testing for the New Century, (2000); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Chang, Juei, Structural specification-based testing: Automated support and experimental evaluation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1687 LNCS, pp. 285-302, (1999)","A.

However, meta-languages such as the MOF (Meta Object Facility)-combined with the OCL (Object Constraint Language) for expressing constraints-used to specify metamodels focus on structural and static semantics but have no built-in support for specifying behavioral semantics. This paper introduces a formal semantic framework for the definition of the semantics of metamodel-based languages.

Methods and techniques supporting rigorous formal design of system architecture where software components interact with each other and control physical components are highly demanded to assure reliability of the system operation. We present a formal model of the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3, the new standard of the European Rail Traffic Management System, aiming to replace the different national train control and command systems by a unique European railway management system. We use the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method to provide a complete specification of the standard. The model has been developed through a sequence of model refinement steps following the incremental way in which requirements describe train operation. We have exploited the ASMETA tool-set supporting the ASMs to simulate the abstract models and validate them with respect to the operational scenarios that are given as part of the requirements. We discuss ambiguities and inconsistencies of the requirements, as well as difficulties encountered in the specification and during scenarios simulation. © 2019 ACM.",Abstract state machines; Formal design; Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS,Formal specification; Railroad traffic control; Railroads; Rails; Software architecture; Software reliability; Abstract state machines; Distributed software system; European rail traffic management systems; Formal design; Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS; Operational scenario; Railway transportation; Scenarios simulations; Railroad transportation,,,,,,,"Abrial, Jean Raymond, The ABZ-2018 case study with event-B, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 322-337, (2018); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Arcaini, Paolo, Modelling the hybrid ERTMS/ETCS level 3 case study in Spin, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 277-291, (2018); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Carioni, Alessandro, A scenario-based validation language for ASMs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5238 LNCS, pp. 71-84, (2008); Cimatti, Alessandro, Formal verification and validation of ERTMS industrial railway train spacing system, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7358 LNCS, pp. 378-393, (2012); Cunha, Alcino, Validating the hybrid ERTMS/ETCS level 3 concept with electrum, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 307-321, (2018); Dghaym, Dana, Diagram-led formal modelling using iUML-B for hybrid ERTMS level 3, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 338-352, (2018); Modelling Analysis Verification and Certification Second International Conference Rssrail 2017, (2017); Tueno Fotso, Steve Jeffrey, Modeling the hybrid ERTMS/ETCS level 3 standard using a formal requirements engineering approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 262-276, (2018)",,"Duchien, L.; Koziolek, A.; Mirandola, R.; Martinez, E.M.N.; Quinton, C.; Scandariato, R.; Scandurra, P.; Trubiani, C.; Weyns, D.",Association for Computing Machinery,,"13th European Conference on Software Architecture, ECSA 2019",2019-09-09 through 2019-09-13,Paris,151597,21531633,9781450377881; 9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201,,,English,ACM Int.

However, implementing auto-scaling mechanisms on cloud frameworks has presented numerous technical challenges. A typical challenge is that, these auto-scalers are often designed on different cloud systems making their evaluation, comparisons and wider applicability problematic. To address this issue, we propose an Abstract State Machine (ASM) model as a solution. Our ASM model was developed systematically according to the behaviours of several auto-scalers, covering the necessary system processes. Rigorous validation and evaluation of our model have been conducted using the CoreASM Model Checker. The results demonstrate that our model can effectively analyze and generate accurate ASM refinements for auto-scalers, even without the need for real-life experiments. Our model, therefore, provides the platform to evaluate the behaviours of algorithms executed on clouds. © 2023 Slovene Society Informatika.

We provide a specification of PSL in ASM, which allows us to integrate PSL properties as part of the design. For the verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the ASM code (containing both the design and the properties) into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage from the ASM language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both a C# code and an FSM representation from an ASM model. We applied our approach on SystemC designs, which are translated into ASM models.

We provide a complete embedding of PSL in the ASM language AsmL, which allows us to integrate PSL properties as a part of the design. For verification, we propose a technique based on the AsmL tool that translates the code containing both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. We use the generated FSM to run model checking on an external tool, here SMV. Our approach takes advantage of the AsmL language capabilities to model designs at the system level as well as from the power of the AsmL tool in generating both C# code and FSMs from AsmL models. We applied our approach on the PCI-X bus standard, which AsmL model was constructed from the informal standard specifications and a subsequent UML model. Experimental results on the PCI-X bus case study showed a superiority of our approach to conventional verification. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Abstract state machines; AsmL; Model checking; PCI-X bus; PSL,Model checking; Specifications; Standards; Abstract state machines; Property Specification Language (PSL); Unified Modeling Language,,,,,,,"Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Claessen, Koen, An operational semantics for weak PSL, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3312, pp. 337-351, (2004); VLSI Design CAD Symp, (2003); undefined, (2008); Dwyer, Matthew B., Tool-supported program abstraction for finite-state verification, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 2001-May, pp. 177-187, (2001); Forum on Specification and Design Languages, (2004); Gawanmeh, Amjad, Embedding and verification of PSL using ASM, pp. 125-130, (2006); Gawanmeh, Amjad, Formal verification of ASMs using MDGs, Journal of Systems Architecture, 54, 1-2, pp. 15-34, (2008); Grieskamp, Wolfgang, Generating finite state machines from abstract state machines, pp. 112-122, (2002); Grosse, Daniel, Checkers for SystemC designs, pp. 171-178, (2004)","A.

ASM is a specification method for software and hardware providing a powerful means of modeling various kinds of systems. MDGs are decision diagrams based on abstract representation of data and are used primarily for modeling hardware systems. The notions of ASM and MDG are hence closely related to each other, making it appealing to link these two concepts. The proposed interface between ASM and MDG uses two steps: first, the ASM model is transformed into a flat, simple transition system as an intermediate model. Second, this intermediate model is transformed into the syntax of the input language of the MDG tool, MDG-HDL.

In November 2000, the formal semantics of SDL- 2000 was officially approved to become part of the SDL language definition. It covers both the static and the dynamic semantics, and is based on the formalism of abstract state machines (ASMs). To support executability, the formal semantics defines, for each SDL specification, reference ASM code, which enables an SDL-to-ASM-compiler. In this paper, we briefly survey and compare existing approaches to define the semantics of SDL formally. The ITU-T approach is then outlined in more detail, addressing the following steps: (1) mapping of non-basic language constructs to the core language, (2) checking of static semantics conditions, (3) definition of the SDL abstract machine (SAM), and (4) definition of the SDL virtual machine (SVM). The paper concludes with experiences from the SDL-to-ASM-compiler project. It is proposed that the SDL-2000 semantics can be adapted and extended to formally define the meaning of UML 2.0 class, composite structure, and statechart diagrams. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In conjunction with the chosen routing strategy, we propose a distributed logical topology based location service (LTLS) protocol and give a formal description and analysis of this protocol on the DASM model. The high dynamics of mobile ad hoc networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks. A strategy for such networks is geographic routing in which each network node can find its physical location via GPS or other navigation technologies. To send a packet, the sender needs to know the most recent physical location of the destination node. This location information is provided by a location service protocol. The LTLS protocol has short message delivery delay, requires small routing tables, uses relatively few administrative packets, and has very good fault tolerance properties. Our goal in defining the network layer protocol in terms of a DASM model is twofold. First, we feel that the mathematical modeling paradigm of distributed abstract state machines provides an ideal formal basis for constructing, analyzing, and validating abstract requirements specifications of mobile ad hoc network protocols. Second, we intend to utilize the resulting behavior model as a formal basis for developing executable specifications serving as a platform for experimental validation of key system attributes and exploration of alternative design choices. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In reality, of course, there are no miracles. A message goes from one network to another; it can be lost or corrupted in the process. Here, we present a realistic but high-level communication model where abstract communicators represent various nets and subnets. The model was originally developed in the process of specifying a particular network architecture, namely, the Universal Plug and Play architecture. But, it is general. Our contention is that every message-based distributed system, properly abstracted, gives rise to a specialization of our abstract communication model. The purpose of the abstract communication model is not to design a new kind of network; rather, it is to discover the common part of all message-based communication networks. The generality of the model has been confirmed by its successful reuse for very different distributed architectures. The model is based on distributed abstract state machines. It is implemented in the specification language AsmL and is used for testing distributed systems. © 2004 IEEE.",,Computer architecture; Computer networks; Computer programming languages; Computer simulation; Distributed computer systems; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Reverse engineering; Semantics; Abstract communication model; Abstract state machines; Network architechture; Plug and play architechture; Requirement specification; System modeling; Software engineering,,,,,,,"Coordination Programming Mechanisms Models and Semantics, (1996); Proc Coordination 2002 Conf, (2002); undefined, (2003); undefined, (2003); Barnett, Mike, Runtime verification of .NET contracts, Journal of Systems and Software, 65, 3, pp. 199-208, (2003); Formal Methods and Tools for Computer Science Eurocast 2001, (2001); Proc Int L Conf Software Eng, (2003); Lncs, (2003); Conformance Checking of Components Against their Non Deterministic Specifications, (2001); Bella, Giampaolo, Formal analysis of the kerberos authentication system, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 3, 12, pp. 1337-1381, (1997)","U.

In [8] Gurevich characterizes the class of sequential ASMs in a purely semantic way by five amazingly general and elegant axioms. In [9] this result is extended to boundednondeterministic ASMs. This paper considers the general case of unbounded-nondeterministic ASMs: in each step, an unbounded-nondeterministic ASM may choose among unboundedly many (sometimes infinitely many) alternatives.

The thesis has been derived from basic principles for sequential algorithms, and for parallel synchronous algorithms. The main result of this paper is that the ASM thesis also holds for quantum algorithms. We first show that, and how, a general model of quantum algorithms (based on the combination of a classical computer with quantum circuits) can be modeled by abstract state machines. Following the approach of Blass and Gurevich to parallel algorithms, we then formulate general postulates for quantum algorithms and show that every algorithm satisfying these postulates is simulated by an appropriate ASM. These ""quantum ASMs"" are special cases of the parallel ASMs of Blass and Gurevich, but the only unbounded parallelism is inside the quantum operations (unitary transformations and measurements). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Abstract state machines; Abstraction level; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum operations; Sequential algorithm; Synchronous algorithms; Unitary transformations; Algorithms,,,,,,,"Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, (2001); Quantum Computing, (1999); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000); Gurevich, Yuri G., Logician in the land of OS: Abstract state machines in microsoft, Proceedings - Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 129-136, (2001); Quantum Computing, (2001); Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Shor, Peter W., Polynomial-time algorithms for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26, 5, pp. 1484-1509, (1997); Vandersypen, Lieven Mark Koenraad, Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance, Nature, 414, 6866, pp. 883-887, (2001)","E.

There are ways to extend the abstract state machine (ASM) framework with distribution aspects, but there is no unifying framework for handling time so far. We propose event structures extended with time as a natural framework for representing state machines and their true concurrency model at a semantic level and for discussing associated time models. Constraints on these timed event structures and their traces (runs) are then used for characterising different frameworks for timed computations. This characterisation of timed frameworks is independent of ASM and allows to compare time models of different modelling formalisms. Finally, we propose some specific extensions of ASM for the expressions of time constraints in accordance with the event-based semantic framework and show the applicability of the obtained framework on an example with a standard time model and a set of consistency properties for timed computations.",Abstract state machines; Event structure; Partial order semantics; Time model,Computation theory; Constraint theory; Mathematical models; Model checking; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Event structure; Partial order semantics; Time models; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Lncs, (1991); Alpern, Bowen, Recognizing safety and liveness, Distributed Computing, 2, 3, pp. 117-126, (1987); Altisen, Karine, Implementation of timed automata: An issue of semantics or modeling?, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3829 LNCS, pp. 273-288, (2005); Alur, Rajeev, Model-checking for real-time systems, Proceedings - Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 414-425, (1990); Lecture Notes in Computer Science, (1993); Alur, Rajeev, A theory of timed automata, Theoretical Computer Science, 126, 2, pp. 183-235, (1994); Alur, Rajeev, Really temporal logic, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, pp. 164-169, (1989); VHDL Cookbook, (1990); Baier, Christel, Metric semantics for true concurrent real time, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1443 LNCS, pp. 568-579, (1998); Baier, Christel, Metric semantics from partial order semantics, Acta Informatica, 34, 9, pp. 701-735, (1997)","S.

The attack scenarios or security requirements in some of these IDSs are specified in attack specification languages which are separate from software specification languages. The use of two different languages for software specification and attack specification may generate redundant and conflicting requirements. The advantage of using the same language for both functional specifications and attacks specifications is that software designers can address the two different issues without learning the two types of languages. We present a method of using a software specification language called Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) as an attack specification language for the open source IDS Snort. This work provides AsmL users an IDS that they can use without knowing how to write Snort rules. We automatically translate attack scenarios written in AsmL into Snort rules with context information. The original Snort is modified so that it can use the rules automatically generated by the translator. Adding context information to Snort rules improves the detection capability of Snort. To show the efficacy of our presented approach, we have built a prototype and evaluated it using a number of well-known attack scenarios. © 2006 ACM.",attack languages; intrusion detection; software security; software specification,Network security; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Specification languages; Specifications; Translation (languages); Abstract state machine languages; Attack language; Attacks scenarios; Computer attacks; Context information; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion detectors; Intrusion-Detection; Software security; Software Specification; Intrusion detection,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC",This research work is partially funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

Care: there is in general no way to compute this critical finite part without querying the function on an arbitrarily larger finite part! Nevertheless, things are different in case there is a uniform bound on the size of the domain of this critical finite part. We prove that, modulo a quadratic blow-up of the bound, one can compute the value of the functional by an algorithm which queries the input function on a uniformly bounded finite part. Up to a constant factor, this quadratic blow-up is optimal. We also characterize such functionals in topological terms using uniformities.

We aim to overcome two facts: 1) simulation is not identification, 2) the ASMs simulating machines of some type do not constitute a natural class among all ASMs. We modify Gurevich's notion of ASM to that of EMA (""Evolving MultiAlgebra"") by replacing the program (which is a syntactic object) by a semantic object: a functional which has to be very simply definable over the static part of the ASM. We prove that very natural classes of EMAs correspond via ""literal identifications"" to slight extensions of the usual machine models and also to grammar models. Though we modify these models, we keep their computation approach: only some contingencies are modified. Thus, EMAs appear as the mathematical model unifying all kinds of sequential computation paradigms. © S. Grigorieff and P.

While IPv6 forwarding and IPv6 transition microblocks may simplify the engineering efforts needed to support Next Generation routing solutions, there must be an efficient and fast mechanism for processing IPv6 headers prior to this. In this paper, we try to develop an IPv6 protocol processing engine based on sequential predicate logic invocations. The design, based on Abstract State Machines (ASM) Logic, shows how the design features may help in resolving scalability issues for large scale IPv6 routing. The novelty of the approach lies in the formal predicate logic definition and synthesis of processing hardware and generation of physical design unit from the data-driven algorithm function computation at compile time.",ASM; IPv6 protocol processing engine,Computation theory; Internet; Logic design; Machine design; Network protocols; Routers; Design; Abstract State Machines (ASM); ASM; IPv6 protocol processing engine; Logic definition; Abstract state machines; Function computations; Important features; IPv6 protocol; Network processing; Processing hardware; Protocol processing; Telecommunication systems; Internet protocols,,,,,,,"undefined, (2006); undefined, (2006); undefined, (2006); Kohler, Eddie, The click modular router, ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 18, 3, pp. 263-297, (2000); Kohler, Eddie, Programming language optimizations for modular router configurations, International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS, pp. 251-263, (2002); Kohler, Eddie, Modular components for network address translation, pp. 39-50, (2002); Model Checking, (1999); Csallner, Christoph, JCrasher: An automatic robustness tester for Java, Software - Practice and Experience, 34, 11, pp. 1025-1050, (2004); Mind, (1950); Software Testing Techniques, (1990)","D.

It is a kind of analysis where you start with a large semantically defined species of algorithms, and you finish up with a syntactic artifact, typically a computation model, that characterizes the species. The task of analyzing a large species of algorithms seems daunting if not impossible. As in quicksand, one needs a rescue point, a fulcrum. In computation analysis, a fulcrum is a particular viewpoint on computation that clarifies and simplifies things to the point that analysis become possible.

It is centered around memory access patterns. Other than dataflow programming it emphasizes on upholding the sequential modification order of each data object. As a consequence the visible side effects on any object can be guaranteed to be identical to a sequential execution. Thus the set of optimizations that are performed are compatible with C's abstract state machine and compilers could perform them, in principle, automatically and unobserved. We present two separate implementations of this model. The first in C++ uses overloading of the operator[] to instrument the memory accesses. The second in Modular C uses annotations and code transformations for the two nested loops. Thereby the code inside the loops may stay as close as possible to the original code such that optimization of that code is not impacted unnecessarily. These implementations show promising results for appropriate benchmarks from polybench and rodinia. © 2019 IEEE.",automatic parallelization; iterative algorithms; memory access classification; parallel control flow,Codes (symbols); Cosine transforms; Iterative methods; Memory architecture; Parallel flow; Abstract state machines; Automatic Parallelization; Dataflow programming; Iterative algorithm; Memory access; Memory access patterns; Parallel control; Sequential execution; C++ (programming language),,,,,,,"Banerjee, Utpal, A theory of data race detection, 2006, pp. 69-78, (2006); First International Workshop on Formal Techniques for Safety Critical Systems Ftscs 2012, (2012); Software Symposium 2017 Ss 2017, (2017); Sánchez, César, On efficient distributed deadlock avoidance for real-time and embedded systems, 2006, pp. 10-19, (2006); Dang, Francis H., The R-LRPD test: Speculative parallelization of partially parallel loops, pp. 183-192, (2002); Bastoul, Cédric, Code generation in the polyhedral model is easier than you think, Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques - Conference Proceedings, PACT, pp. 7-16, (2004); Martinez Caamaño, Juan Manuel, Full runtime polyhedral optimizing loop transformations with the generation, instantiation, and scheduling of code-bones, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 29, 15, (2017); Saltz, Joel Haskin, Run-Time Parallelization and Scheduling of Loops, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 40, 5, pp. 603-612, (1991); Venkat, Anand, Automating Wavefront Parallelization for Sparse Matrix Computations, International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, SC, 0, pp. 480-491, (2016); Huang, Jialu, Automatically exploiting cross-invocation parallelism using runtime information, (2013)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"27th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing, PDP 2019",2019-02-13 through 2019-02-15,Pavia,146395,,9.78173E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Euromicro Int.

In this paper, we present an approach to design and verify SystemC models at the transaction level. We integrate the verification as part of the design flow where we first model both the design and the properties (written in Property Specification language) in Unifed Modeling Language (UML); then, we translate them into an intermediate format modeled with AsmL [language based on Abstract State Machines (ASM)]. The AsmL model is used to generate a finite state machine of the design, including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on the fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be reused to validate the design at lower levels by simulation. For existing SystemC designs, we propose to translate the code back to AsmL in order to apply the same verification approach. At the SystemC level, we also present a genetic algorithm to enhance the assertions coverage. We will ensure the soundness of our approach by proving the correctness of the SystemC-to-AsmL and AsmL-to-SystemC transformations. We illustrate our approach on two case studies including the PCI bus standard and a master/slave generic architecture from the SystemC library. © 2006 IEEE.",System-level design; System-level verification; SystemC; Transaction-level modeling,System-level design; System-level verification; SystemC; Transaction-level modeling; Circuit theory; Finite automata; Mathematical models; Product design; Systems analysis,,,,,,,"Accellera Property Specification Language Reference Manual Version 1 01, (2004); Cousot, Patrick, Systematic design of program analysis frameworks, Conference Record of the Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, pp. 269-282, (1979); Cousot, Patrick, Abstract interpretation frameworks, Journal of Logic and Computation, 2, 4, pp. 511-547, (1992); Cousot, Patrick, Systematic design of program transformation frameworks by abstract interpretation, Conference Record of the Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, pp. 178-190, (2002); Damasevicius, Robertas, Application of UML for hardware design based on design process model, Proceedings of the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, ASP-DAC, pp. 244-249, (2004); Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems Tacas, (2002); Gordon, Michael J.C., Validating the PSL/Sugar Semantics Using Automated Reasoning, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 4, pp. 406-421, (2003); Introduction to Hol A Theorem Proving Environment for Higher Order Logic, (1993); undefined, (2004); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995)","A.

We considered as illustrative case a Packet Switch model part of the SystemC library. We propose a verification methodology composed of two steps: (1) static code analysis using abstract interpretation; and (2) model checking. This latter is performed thanks to an integration of both the Property Specification Language (PSL) and the SystemC semantics in the Abstract States Machines (ASMs). We propose a technique based on a reachability algorithm part of the AsmL tool that translates the ASM code combining both the design and the properties into a finite state machine (FSM) representation.

The ASM model is used to generate an FSM of the design including the properties. Checking the correctness of the properties is performed on-the-fly while generating the state machine. Finally, we translate the verified design to SystemC and map the properties to a set of assertions (as monitors in C#) that can be re-used to validate the design at lower levels through simulation.

Second, the original Mondex case study verifies functional correctness assuming a suitable security protocol.

Computer architects and designers continue to look for ways to take advantage from it to produce ever more complex microprocessors. Meanwhile, market forces are dictating a shorter time to market, a proliferation of product and steeper volume ramps in production. However, it is evident that logic correctness is one of the main challenges that computer engineers usually face during the design and validation of such systems. In the last 20 years, researchers and industrial experts invented several modeling and validation technologies, such as logic simulation, fast hardware emulation engines, and formal methods. However the design size and complexity continue to grow and outstrip what the validation techniques can do for producing high quality and correct systems. As a results, the validation problem is becoming more complex to solve and is indeed the main limiter for producing a high quality silicon products. Design abstraction and high level modeling is a fundamental design strategy to cope with system complexity. The basic idea is to hide design implementation details, while focusing on design specification, capturing the pure logic properties and behaviors of the system. Doing this, we believe that the size of the design model can be dramatically decreased because none functional or physical properties of the design are excluded. Therefore the design representation is purely logical and have a clear semantics which it becomes easier to understand, easier and faster to validate using dynamic or formal techniques, so design errors can be detected earlier before going into detailed implementation and thus avoid a costly design iterations due to late soundness issues. In this talk we will present abstract modeling techniques and their verification challenges. In particular we will describe the Abstract State Machines approach for modeling and verification of high level models. In addition we will outline several research topics in this domain to encourage the academic community to take an active part in exploring and developing new verification methods that can cope with the increasing complexity of microprocessors' design. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,Abstracting; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Problem solving; Transistors; Abstract modeling; Design abstraction; Moore's Law; Steeper volume ramps; Microprocessor chips,,,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,"2nd International Symposium on Computer Science in Russia, CSR 2007",,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

We provide a new formal framework for algorithm level modelling-design modelling at a high abstraction level, focused exclusively on function and algorithms. The semantics of our models is based on Abstract State Machines with synchronous parallel execution, sequential execution, and nondeterminism. To express models we propose an executable, object-oriented Architecture Specification Language with rich data types and a well-defined formal semantics, based initially on Microsoft's AsmL. We describe an experimental framework for direct symbolic execution of models in this language, intended as a basis for both property and refinement verification, as well as design exploration. We explain and illustrate our approach through a case study, the modelling a simple μop scheduler and its refinement towards a design model for circuit implementation. We aim to show the utility of our language and symbolic execution framework for exploring microarchitectural algorithm and to validate designs using dynamic or formal techniques, yielding more productive convergence to high quality implementations. © 2009 Crown.",,Abstract state machines; Abstraction level; Algorithm level; Circuit designs; Circuit implementation; Data type; Design Exploration; Design models; EXPRESS model; Formal framework; Formal Semantics; Formal techniques; Functional validation; High-quality implementation; MicroSoft; Non-determinism; Object-oriented architectures; Parallel executions; Sequential execution; Symbolic execution; Abstracting; Algorithms; Convergence of numerical methods; Design; Formal logic; Formal methods; Integrated circuit manufacture; Linguistics; Object oriented programming; Semantics; Specification languages; Mathematical models,,,,,,,"Bentley, Bob, Validating a modern microprocessor, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3576, pp. 2-4, (2005); IEEE the Open Systemc Initiative, (2008); Inria Report, (2010); Hoe, James C., Synthesis of operation-centric hardware descriptions, IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, Digest of Technical Papers, 2000-January, pp. 511-518, (2000); Specifying Systems the Tla Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers, (2002); Vardi, Moshe Y., Formal techniques for SystemC verification: Position Paper, pp. 188-192, (2007); Decision Procedures an Algorithmic Point of View, (2008); Asml the Abstract State Machine Language, (2006); undefined, (2010); Gurevich, Yuri G., Semantic essence of AsmL, Theoretical Computer Science, 343, 3, pp. 370-412, (2005)","Z.

Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while non-functional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language. We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis. We illustrate the applicability of our approach using a business process model (conference review process model) and a real-time system model (IP multicast routing case study). © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.",Abstract State Machines (ASM); Non-functional; Requirements; Time modeling; Timed Use Case Maps (TUCM); User Requirements Notation (URN),Computer software; High level languages; Interactive computer systems; Life cycle; Management science; Network routing; Real time systems; Requirements engineering; Time sharing systems; Abstract state machines; Non-functional; Requirements; Time model; Use case maps; User requirements notation; Software design,,,,,,,"Alur, Rajeev, A theory of timed automata, Theoretical Computer Science, 126, 2, pp. 183-235, (1994); Ottawa, (1994); In Sbrc 99 17th Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks, (1999); Pp 5772, (1995); Objectime Workshop on Research in 00 Real Time Modeling, (1998); Amyot, Daniel, User requirements notation: The first ten years, the next ten years, Journal of Software, 6, 5, pp. 747-768, (2011); Amyot, Daniel, UCM-driven testing of web applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3530, pp. 247-264, (2005); undefined; Apvrille, Ludovic, TURTLE: A real-time UML profile supported by a formal validation toolkit, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 30, 7, pp. 473-487, (2004); undefined",,,Springer London,,,,,,09473602,,,,English,Requir.

This paper presents a novel approach to perform schedulability analysis at the requirement stage using Timed Use Case Maps (TUCM) language. The proposed approach relies on the computation of Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET), resource allocation and scheduling policies. Timing and resource constraints are first incorporated into UCM specifications, then mapped to Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism and implemented in AsmL language, allowing for simulation and schedulability analysis.

Mutation testing is a well-established fault-based technique for assessing and improving the quality of test suites. Mutation testing can be applied at different levels of abstraction, e.g., the unit level, the integration level, and the specification level. In this paper, we propose a suite of AsmetaL-specific mutation operators, classified into four categories. The proposed operators are used to assess the adequacy of test suites generated using the ATGT tool, according to various test coverage criteria. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through eight publicly available AsmetaL case studies. The results of the case studies show that our proposed mutation operators can be used to compare different AsmetaL-based test coverage criteria and successfully detect inadequacies in test suites. © 2015, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",Abstract state machines (ASM); Adequacy; AsmetaL; Mutation operator; Mutation testing; Specification; Test suite; Testcoverage criteria,,,,,,(IN121009),,"Morell, Larry J., A Theory of Fault-Based Testing, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 16, 8, pp. 844-857, (1990); DeMillo, Richard A., Hints on test data selection: Help for the practicing programmer, Computer, 11, 4, pp. 34-41, (1978); Ammann, Paul E., A specification-based coverage metric to evaluate test sets, pp. 239-248, (1999); Jia, Yue, An analysis and survey of the development of mutation testing, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 649-678, (2011); Fabbri, Sandra Camargo Pinto Ferraz, Mutation analysis testing for finite state machines, Proceedings - International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE, pp. 220-229, (1994); Pinto Ferraz Fabbri, Sandra Camargo, Mutation testing applied to validate specifications based on Statecharts, Proceedings - International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE, pp. 210-219, (1999); Batth, Samrat S., Specification of timed EFSM fault models in SDL, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4574 LNCS, pp. 50-65, (2007); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); International Journal on Advances in Software, (2013); undefined","J.

A Gurevich abstract state machine was given in evidence that Ibn Sīnā really did intend an algorithm; this was needed because Ibn Sīnā explained the algorithm by a long sequence of exercises, not by a rigorous definition. More recently a radically original logical decision algorithm has come to light in the work of the 12th century Baghdad scholar Abū al-Barakāt. Taking these algorithms alongside the already known algorithms of al-Khwārizmī for solving quadratic equations, and of al-Khalīl for listing finite sequences of letters, we can see that the medieval Arabic scholars uncovered a range of algorithms of various kinds. But it seems that they never brought these algorithms together under a single notion of ‘algorithm’; in fact we know of no writer who drew a comparison between any two of these algorithms. A natural question for historical research is to uncover what kinds of entity the medieval Arabic scholars thought these algorithms were. The present paper assembles some raw material that should be relevant to this question, including a not very successful attempt by al-Fārābī to institute a theory of logical procedures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Abū al-Barakāt; al-Khalīl; Algorithm; Ibn Sīnā; Medieval Arabic,Computer science; Computers; Abstract state machines; Finite sequence; Historical research; Logical decisions; Logical procedures; Long sequences; Proof search; Quadratic equations; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Reprinted from Hyderabad, (1938); Chatti, Saloua, Al-Fārābī Syllogism: An Abridgement of Aristotle’s Prior Analytics, pp. 1-214, (2020); Arab and Arabic Linguistics Traditional and New Theoretical Approaches Journal of Semitic Studies Supplement 34, (2014); Annales De Mathematiques Pures Et Appliquees, (1817); Jews in Islamic Countries in the Middle Ages, (2004); Arabic Lexicography, (1965); Hodges, Wilfrid, Ibn Sīnā on analysis: 1.

Requirements for dynamic service mediation were derived from a real-world case. The conceptual model and the algorithms are developed and implemented by a proof of concept for this case. This model is build on existing means for sharing public services, which would enable migration of existing applications to our proposed approach.

Since there is no preimage operation in MDG due to the presence of abstract state variables, all backward reduction algorithms can not be used in MDG. In this paper we propose a simple but powerful way to construct a reduced abstract transition system derived from the original ASM by using only the transition relations of the so-called property dependent state variables VP of the property P to be verified. It is easy to be shown that the abstract system so constructed strongly preserves P, and consequently the abstract system constructed using only a subset of VP weakly preserves P. The critical thing is how to select the subset of VP. We present here a heuristic iterative reduction algorithm for verifying the properties. At each iteration step, we trace further the property dependency graph and add a noncorrelated set of state variables to the current set of state variables to construct a more detailed model. The algorithm can handle with both abstract and concrete state variables.

The ways to reach the autonomy are described - high reliability and adaptability of the system, reached by application of Al elements, formal structural models (specification, verification and real time control) and dynamic reconfiguration [1,2,4,9,10,11]. A method using trace models in real time for testing of system operations is described The method is suitable for systems specified by process algebras (CSP - Communicating Sequential Processes [3], Timed CSP [6], ASM - Abstract State Machine [5], and TAM - Temporal Agent Model [7]) where process traces are used The computing processes and these in the hardware are observed. Special control processes (tracers) are specified. They allow to control in real time the correspondence of the real system traces and preliminary computed traces (the formal specification) and send messages to the other subsystems when no correspondence (e.g. to specification and dynamic reconfiguration subsystems). The method allows finding In real time the software and hardware incorrectly functioning (disparity of the traces) based on rigorous mathematical specification. In the paper are described: an autonomous control system structural model, an algorithm for real time traces control, software simulations (laboratory models) of autonomous systems, the faults and reaction of the tracer-processes, all based on CPPCSP - C++ Communicating Sequential Processes library [8]. The application of trace models in real time allows find any system incorrectly operating and this is one of the ways for increasing the onboard computer systems' reliability and to achieve full operation autonomy. © 2005 IEEE.",,Algebra; Autonomous agents; Computer systems; Mathematical models; Object oriented programming; Reliability; Spacecraft; Adaptability; Autonomous control system; Onboard computer systems; Trace models; Real time control,,,,,,,"undefined, (2007); Hristov, Plamen L., A model of autonomous control system for deep space missions, pp. 392-396, (2003); undefined, (2007); Proceedings of the AIAA 1999, (1999); Technical Report, (2002); Proceedings Icalp 86, (1986); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2001); Formalizing New Navigation Requirements for NASA Space Shuttle, (1999)","P.L.

However, difficulties were often encountered when trying to formalize the complex underlying computations in security protocols. Some flaws of the security protocols, especially the ones that caused by the computations weakness, cannot be detected owing to the simple abstractions of its underlying computations. In this paper, we present a method to verify a key establishment protocol HMQV, where we propose a simple formalization of its underlying Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. The formal model of HMQV is verified by our newly released model checker ASM-SPV (Abstract State Machines-Security Protocol Verifier).

An application of the ASM methodology to the verification of a pipelined microprocessor (an ARM2 implementation) is described. Both the sequential execution model and final pipelined model are formalized using ASMs. A series of intermediate models are introduced that gradually expose the complications of pipelining. The first intermediate model is proven equivalent to the sequential model in the absence of structural, control, and data hazards.

In the ASM literature, however, there is a tendency to omit reflection on the process of ASM-based design and analysis, focusing instead on final, complete ASM products. As educators, we believe it is important to expose our students to a full, explicit process of inquiry, using ASMs as a vehicle to motivate active questioning. We report on our experiences in bringing ASM-based inquiry to the classroom. A course plan that combines ASMs and Problem Frames has proved effective in eliciting critical inquiry among students. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",education; formal methods; inquiry; refinement; software requirements,Abstract state machines; Design and analysis; inquiry; Problem Frames; refinement; Software problems; Software requirements; Abstracting; Computer science; Computer software; Contour followers; Requirements engineering; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Formal methods,,,,,,,"Bella, Giampaolo, Formal analysis of the kerberos authentication system, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 3, 12, pp. 1337-1381, (1997); Berry, Daniel M., The importance of ignorance in requirements engineering, Journal of Systems and Software, 28, 2, pp. 179-184, (1995); Handbook I the Cognitive Domain, (1956); Börger, Egon, Why use evolving algebras for hardware and software engineering?, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1012, pp. 236-271, (1995); Logic Programming Formal Methods and Practical Applications, (1994); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Java and the Java Virtual Machine Definition Verification Validation, (2001); Börger, Egon, Initialization problems for Java, Software-Concepts and Tools, 19, 4, pp. 175-178, (2000); Brady, Ann, Addressing communication issues in software development: A case study approach, Software Engineering Education Conference, Proceedings, pp. 301-308, (2007); Brady, Ann, Speaking of software: Case studies in software communication, pp. 75-97, (2008)","J.

How to validate the effectiveness of these designs remains an unsolved problem. Prior works assess the security of architectures empirically without a formal guarantee, making the evaluation results less convincing. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology based on formal methods for security verification of cache architectures. Specifically, we design an entropy-based noninterference reasoning framework with two unwinding conditions to assess the information leakage of the cache designs. The reasoning framework quantifies the dependency relationships by the mutual information between the distributions of input and output of side channels. Given a cache design, we formalize its behavior specification along with the cache layouts into an abstract state machine, to instantiate the parameterized reasoning framework that discloses any potential vulnerabilities. We use our methodology to assess eight state-of-the-art cache architectures to demonstrate reliability as well as flexibility. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cache designs; Security verification; Side-channel attacks,Architecture; Formal verification; Cache architecture; Cache design; Evaluation results; Prevent information leakage; Reasoning framework; Security verification; Security-aware; Side-channel; Side-channel attacks; Unsolved problems; Side channel attack,,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (NRF2018 NCR-NCR009-0001); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (RS02/19); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; Nanyang Technological University, NTU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62132014); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Acknowledgements.

Based on the atlas transformation language (ATL) framework, the associated translating tool AADL2TASM was implemented by defining the meta-model of both AADL and TASM, and the ATL transformation rules.

The aim of SOA is to automate web service tasks, such as, web service discovery, selection, composition and execution. Since XML is a syntax-based language, the automation of these tasks is still a challenge. To overcome this, web services can be described semantically using an ontology description language, e.g., Web Ontology Language (OWL), giving rise to semantic web services (SWS). Because semantic web services are relatively new, there has been little research into testing and quality assurance aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating test cases based on user requirements for testing semantic web services. In SWS frameworks, such as, Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO), the user requirements are presented as a goal specification in terms of a state model. We use a model checking approach to generate test cases from this state model. To achieve this, we represent a set of rules for translation from a goal specification to a formal B abstract state machine. The B representation of the goal specification is given as input to the model checker to generate concrete test cases using the assertion violation property of the model checker. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated using a real world case study based on, the Amazon E-commerce Service. © 2009 IEEE.",,Formal methods; Information services; Model checking; Network architecture; Ontology; Quality assurance; Semantic Web; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Specifications; Websites; XML; Abstract state machines; Amazon e-commerce service; Goal specifications; Ontology description language; Testing semantics; Web ontology language; Web service discovery; Web service modelling ontology; Web services,,,,,,,"Tsai, Weitek, On testing and evaluating service-oriented software, Computer, 41, 8, pp. 40-46, (2008); Tsai, Weitek, Coyote: An XML-based framework for Web services testing, Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering, 2002-January, pp. 173-174, (2002); Sneed, Harry M., WSDLTest - A tool for testing web services, pp. 14-21, (2006); Siblini, Reda, Testing web services, 2005, pp. 763-770, (2005); Dai, Guilan, Contract-based testing for web services, Proceedings - IEEE Computer Society's International Computer Software and Applications Conference, 1, pp. 517-524, (2007); Wang, Yongbo, Ontology-based test case generation for testing web services, pp. 43-50, (2007); Mindreef, (2010); Soaptest, (2010); Jokhio, M.

Several transaction protocols have been suggested for the transaction management, but they are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity interrupts message exchanges among BPMSs which use different transaction protocols, so that the interoperability among the BPMSs cannot be guaranteed. To solve this problem, this paper suggests a semantics-based protocol for business process transactions. The suggested protocol is composed of the static semantics and the operational semantics. In the context of the static semantics, transaction states and messages are defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In the context of the operational semantics, state transitions of business process transactions are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM). The suggested approach is expected to enhance interoperability among heterogeneous BPMSs, to increase the understandability for the transaction protocols, and to support automatic transaction execution and systematic transaction monitoring. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,Computer programming languages; Data transfer; Management information systems; Network protocols; Problem solving; World Wide Web; Business Process Management System (BPMS); Business process transactions; Static semantics; Transaction management; Web Ontology Language; Semantics,,,,,,,"International Journal of Intelligent Systems in Accounting Finance and Management, (2002); Web Services Atomic Transaction, (2025); Web Services Business Activity Framework, (2004); Web Services Transaction Management Ws Txm, (2003); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Dalal, Sanjay, Coordinating business transactions on the web, IEEE Internet Computing, 7, 1, pp. 30-39, (2003); Web Service Modeling Ontology Wsmo Specification, (2005); Business Transaction Protocol, (2004); Conferences in Research and Practice of Information Technology, (2003); Owl Web Ontology Language Overview, (2004)","D.

Since the algorithm used for this computation is not Turing Machine reducible, neither is it Turing Machine describable, or describable by an equivalent formalism. That it is effective and mechanical, however, is intuitively obvious. I draw two conclusions. First, that there are calculators that are not isomorphic to Turing Machines and, so, the Church-Turing thesis, according to at least one interpretation, fails. The interpretation that is challenged is that all maximal models of computation are equivalent up to isomorphism to Turing Machines. Second, I draw the conclusion that the human brain/mind is not equivalent up to isomorphism to Turing Machines. Finally, I put forward a conjecture about why this might be so. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Abstract state machines; Ackermann function; Church-Turing thesis; Recursive way of thinking; Turing Machine isomorphism,,,,,,,"Special thanks to Nicola Angius, Douglas Campbell, Nachum Dershowitz, Marie Dimarongkona, Florent Franchette, Petros Stephaneas for some useful comments.

Ensuring the correctness of the design at the earliest stage possible is a major challenge in any software development process. In this context, formal verification is a very appealing approach in addition to simulation and testing, since it implies an exhaustive exploration of all possible behaviours of a system. In this paper, we present an approach towards model based formal verification for DPCS by means of model checking. The presented work is a part of the ISILEIT project that aims at the development of a seamless methodology for the integrated design, analysis and validation of distributed production control systems. A prerequisite for model based formal verification is the existence of a formal model of the designed system. According to the ISILEIT design methodology a system is specified and modelled using an integrative specification language that combines modeling concepts taken from two different specification languages, namely the UML and the SDL languages. However, supporting formal verification for such a heterogeneous language implies requirements on formal unification and semantic integration of the adopted modeling concepts. In our approach the Abstract State Machines (ASM) formalism represents the formal platform for the unification and semantic integration. We show how the ASMs, in particular the AsmL language, have been successfully applied for creating a rigorous unified semantic model that integrates the semantics of UML State Machines, SDL Block Diagrams and Story Diagrams which form the core of the integrative specification language used in ISILEIT. Besides the integration purpose, the ASMs serve as a basis for the application of model checking techniques. Therefore, the rest of the paper presents the work on adoption of state-of-the-art model checking techniques in order to support model checking of the ASM (AsmL) models. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,Control system analysis; Formal verification; Integration; Modeling languages; Production control; Semantics; Software design; Specification languages; Specifications; Abstract state machines; Design Methodology; Design of softwares; Distributed production control systems; Model-checking techniques; Semantic integration; Simulation and testing; Software development process; Model checking,,,,,,,"undefined, (2007); An Engineer S Workstation to Support Integrated Development of Flexible Production Control Systems, (2007); Unified Modeling Language User Guide, (1999); Recommendation Z 100 Specification and Description Language Sdl, (1996); Lncs, (1998); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); undefined, (2007); Asml the Abstract State Machine Language Version 2 0, (2015); undefined, (2007); Eschbach, Robert, Formal definition of SDL-2000 - Compiling and running SDL specifications as ASM models, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 7, 11, pp. 1024-1049, (2001)","M.

We have implemented the approach and our experiments with some real-world case studies show the viability of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.",Abstract State Machines; AI Planning; Workflow Patterns,Abstract state machines; Abstract workflow; AI planning; Automated support; Executables; Post process; Real-world; Runtimes; Work-flows; Workflow patterns; Forestry,,,,,,,"Börger, Egon, Modeling workflow patterns from first principles, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4801 LNCS, pp. 1-20, (2007); Chung, Paul W.H., Knowledge-based process management - An approach to handling adaptive workflow, Knowledge-Based Systems, 16, 3, pp. 149-160, (2003); Delias, Pavlos, Optimizing resource conflicts in workflow management systems, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 23, 3, pp. 417-432, (2011); May 1997 Draft of the ASM Guide, (1997); Hatzi, Ourania, An integrated approach to automated semantic web service composition through planning, IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, 5, 3, pp. 319-332, (2012); IEEE Scc, (2013); IEEE Scc, (2013); Marrella, Andrea, Featuring automatic adaptivity through workflow enactment and planning, pp. 372-381, (2011); Marrella, Andrea, Synthesizing a library of process templates through partial-order planning algorithms, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 147 LNBIP, pp. 277-291, (2013); Ghallab, Malik, Automated Planning: Theory and Practice, pp. 1-635, (2004)",,"Miller, J.A.; Zhu, H.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC); Services Computing Professional Interest Community (PIC) at IBM Research and Huawei; Services Society (SS),"IEEE International Conference on Web Services, ICWS 2015",2015-06-27 through 2015-07-02,New York,116880,,9781467372725; 9781467380904,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

TLM allows designers to focus on functionality while abstracting implementation details. At the register transfer level (RTL), however, different modules communicate through detailed pin level signaling. SoC design methodologies involve the integration of different intellectual property (IP) blocks modeled at different levels of abstraction. Therefore a special module or channel is needed in order to link modules, IPs, designed at different abstraction levels. This module, called transactor, can be modeled using a finite state machine (FSM) providing a functional specification of the protocol's behavior. In this paper, we propose a methodology to specify transactors using graphical finite state machine (FSM). This technique enables an automatic generation of SystemC TLM-RTL transactors via an intermediate translation of the user-defined FSM to the Abstract State Machines Language (AsmL). The UTOPIA standard protocol is provided as an illustration of this approach. © 2007 IEEE.",AsmL; Finite state machine; SystemC; Transactor,Abstracting; Application specific integrated circuits; Human computer interaction; Integrated circuits; Internet protocols; Microelectronics; Microprocessor chips; Programmable logic controllers; Abstract state machines; Abstraction levels; AsmL; Automatic generations; Complex systems; Finite state machine; Functional specifications; Intellectual property blocks; Levels of abstractions; Link modules; Modeling methods; OR channels; Register transfer levels; SOC designs; Standard protocols; SystemC; Transaction-level-modeling; Transactor; Contour followers,,,,,,,"undefined, (2007); undefined, (2008); Balarin, Felice, Functional verification methodology based on formal interface specification and transactor generation, Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE, 1, (2006); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Bombieri, Nicola, On the evaluation of transactor-based verification for reusing TLM assertions and testbenches at RTL, Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE, 1, (2006); undefined, (2008); Asml Abstract State Machines Language, (2007); Systemc Library, (2007); Pnueli, Amir, The temporal logic of programs, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, 1977-October, pp. 46-57, (1977); Transaction Level Modeling in Systemc Open Systemc Initiative, (2006)","T.

However, because of Convergence Failure Bugs (CFBs), many distributed systems do not provide even this basic guarantee. The violation of the convergence property can be crucial to safety-critical applications collectively working together with a shared distributed system. Indeed, many CFBs are reported as major issues by developers. Our key insight is that CFBs are caused by divergence, or differences between the state of replicas, and that a focused exploration of divergence states can reveal bugs in the convergence logic of real distributed systems while avoiding state explosion. Based on this insight, we have designed and implemented Modulo, the first Model-Based Testing tool using Divergence Resync Models (DRMs) to systematically explore divergence and convergence in real distributed systems. Modulo uses DRMs to explore an abstract state machine of the system and derive schedules, the intermediate representation of test cases, which are then translated into test inputs and injected into systems under test (SUTs). We ran Modulo to check ZooKeeper, MongoDB, and Redis and found 11 bugs (including 6 previously unknown ones). © 2022 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, ATC 2022.All rights reserved.",,Failure (mechanical); Program debugging; Safety engineering; Abstract state machines; Consistency model; Convergence properties; Distributed systems; Intermediate representations; Model-based testing tool; Real distributed systems; Safety critical applications; State explosion; Test case; Model checking,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1749711); National Science Foundation, NSF; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-05931); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Research Chairs","This research was supported by NSERC Discovery Grant RGPIN-2018-05931, a Canada Research Chair, and NSF CNS-1749711.","Apache Hbase; Couchbase Server; Memcachedb; undefined; Riak; Alagappan, Ramnatthan, Correlated crash vulnerabilities, pp. 151-167, (2016); Alquraan, Ahmed, An analysis of network-partitioning failures in cloud systems, pp. 51-68, (2007); Synchronization Code on the Follower does Not Properly Truncate Uncommitted Write Resulting in Data Inconsistency, (2017); Truncate Function in Filetxnlog Java May Fail to Properly Remove an Uncommitted Write Resulting in Data Inconsistency, (2017); Convergence Fail When A Follower Tries to Resync with A Leader having Incomplete Commitlog, (2020)",,,USENIX Association,Alibaba Group; Apple; et al.; PagerDuty; USENIX Association; VMware University Research Fund,"2022 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, ATC 2022",2022-07-11 through 2022-07-13,Carlsbad,183226,,9.78194E+12,,,English,"Proc.

We are particularly interested in showing that concrete protocols for multi-level transaction processing arise as refinements of an abstract ground model specification. Furthermore, we are interested in the proof of desirable properties of such schedulers such as the correctness and if possible also completeness with respect to serialisability, and the recoverability of the accepted schedules.

There has been a trend over the last decade towards implementations based on multiprocessor distributed concurrent systems with software components allocated to processors. Designing the system-wide operation, synchronisation and exception handling for such a complex system becomes impossible at the level of traditional process synchronisation primitives, as it becomes intellectually unmanageable to grasp the system-wide behaviour when tackled piecemeal and ‘bottom up’. An alternative top down approach to structuring and designing the overall behaviour of highly concurrent systems implemented using components is presented. It is based on using one or more simple abstract state machines to define the system-wide synchronisation required in terms of the desired systemlevel behaviour rather than in terms of the low-level synchronisation primitives chosen for the fine grain of the implementation solution. A practical example involving the creation of a high availability processing system made up of several commercial quality computers is used to illustrate the concept. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",Abstract components; Abstract state machines; Concurrency and synchronisation; Partitioning; Patterns; Software components; Subsystems; System architecture,Design; Object oriented programming; Synchronization; Abstract state machines; Partitioning; Patterns; Software component; Subsystems; System architectures; Computer architecture,,,,,,,"Research Directions in Object Oriented Programming, (1987); Notes on the Synthesis of Form, (1964); Timeless Way of Building, (1979); Dijkstra, Edsger W., The structure of the 舠THE舡-multiprogramming system, Communications of the ACM, 11, 5, pp. 341-346, (1968); Real Time Systems Uml Addison Wesley; Gentleman, W.

It is difficult to present the precise semantics which are taken as important in workflow system with the guide provided by OMG to the UML activity diagram.

As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data used in OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. Typical OLAP queries are data intensive, and thus time consuming. In order to speed up the query computation, it is a common practice to materialize some of the computations as views based on a set of queries given. In general we wish to optimize query time under a given maintenance constraints. However, OLAP queries are not static and may change over time. Thus designing data warehouse is an ongoing task. This process is also called dynamic or incremental design. In this paper, we approach this issue as a refinement step in our Abstract State Machine (ASM) based data warehouse design, and support it by a set of standard refinement rules.

Based on a purified Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) variant, the authors present proposals for several important issues in BPM that have not been adequately considered in the BPMN 2.0 standard. It focusses on modality as well as actor and user interaction modelling and offers an enhanced communication concept. In order to render models executable, the semantics of the modelling language needs to be described rigorously enough to prevent deviating interpretations by different tools. For this reason, the semantics of the necessary concepts introduced in this book are defined using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method. Finally, the authors show how the different parts of the model fit together using a simple example process, and introduce the enhanced Process Platform (eP2) architecture, which binds all the different components together. The resulting method is named Hagenberg Business Process Modelling (H-BPM) after the Austrian village where it was designed. The motivation for the development of the H-BPM method stems from several industrial projects in which business analysts and software developers struggled with redundancies and inconsistencies in system documentation due to missing integration. The book is aimed at researchers in business process management and industry 4.0 as well as advanced professionals in these areas. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Administrative data processing; Enterprise resource management; Process engineering; Semantics; Systems engineering; Abstract state machines; Business analysts; Business process management; Business process model and notation (BPMN); Business process modelling; Industrial projects; Process modelling; Software developer; Modeling languages,,,,,,,"Aldred, Lachlan, Process integration, pp. 489-511, (2010); Bpmnprocessmodeling Freemodeling Tool, (2015); Auer, Dagmar, Extending BPMN with submit/response-style user interaction modeling, pp. 368-374, (2009); Blankenhorn, Kai, A UML profile for GUI layout, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3263, pp. 110-121, (2004); Bpms Business Process Management System; Business Process Management with Adonis and the Adonis Process Portal; Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4, (2015); Aris Design Platform Getting Started with Bpm, (2007); Draheim, Dirk, Integrated framework for seamless modeling of business and technical aspects in process-oriented enterprise applications, International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 22, 5, pp. 645-674, (2012)",,,Springer International Publishing,,,,,,,9783319304960; 9783319304953,,,English,Hagenberg Bus.

The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a solution providing both application and middleware transparency at the same time. Compatibility and integrity requirements are identified and corresponding conditions are established using Abstract State Machines. The most relevant checkpointing systems are checked against the conditions in order to examine their conformity. Based on the conditions, a novel checkpointing method is defined and a proof of concept checkpointing tool, called TotalCheckpoint (TCKPT) is introduced. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Yet a substantial share of business processes is difficult to predict with exceptions to the core processes occurring frequently. This contribution proposes to explicitly consider exceptions and handle them according to their degree of standardized behavior. A methodology comprising three main components provides guidance for this new perspective on exceptions: (1) a classification details the types of exceptions that are encountered in real-world S-BPM projects. (2) An approach inspired by the exception handling mechanisms in software engineering advises methods and tools for handling the exception types and suggests a corresponding escalation mechanism. Both the classification and the procedure model are validated by ten domain experts. (3) The S-BPM notation is extended in order to effectively leverage the proposed approach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.,Abstract State Machine; Adaptive Case Management; Event driven business process management; Exception Handling; Happy Path,Software engineering; Abstract state machines; Business process management; Case management; Exception handling; Happy Path; Enterprise resource management,,,,,,,"Antunes, Pedro A., BPM and exception handling: Focus on organizational resilience, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews, 41, 3, pp. 383-392, (2011); Journal of Business Forecasting, (2011); Survey on Exceptions in Office Information Systems, (1994); Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Business Information Systems, (2000); Casati, Fabio, Specification and Implementation of Exceptions in Workflow Management Systems, ACM Transactions on Database Systems, 24, 3, pp. 405-451, (1999); Saastamoinen, Heikki, Case study on exceptions, Information Technology and People, 8, 4, pp. 48-78, (1995); Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems, (1995); Subjektorientiertes Prozessmanagement Mitarbeiter Einbinden Motivation Und Prozessakzeptanz Steigern, (2011); Betriebliche Anwendungssysteme Prozeorientierte Gestaltung Von Informationssystemen, (1998); Service Orientierte Architekturen Mit Web Services Konzepte Standards Praxis, (2007)","M.

At a logical level, this possibility is realized by permitting implications to be embedded in goals. Program clauses that appear in the antecedents of such implications may contain variables that are bound by external quantifiers, leading to non-local variables in procedure declarations. In compiling programs in this extended language, there is, therefore, a need to consider the addition to given programs of program clauses that are parameterized by bindings for some of their variables. A proposed approach to dealing with this aspect uses a closure representation for clauses. This representation separates an instance of a clause with parameterized bindings into a skeleton part that is fixed at compile-time and an environment that maintains the part that is dynamically determined. A development of this implementation scheme is provided here by starting with an abstract interpreter for the language and then refining this to arrive at an interpreter that uses the closure representation for clauses. The abstract state machine formalism of Gurevich is used in specifying the interpreters that are of interest at the two different stages. We also justify this refinement by showing that the essential notion of a computation is preserved by the refinement and thus the refinement is a correct one. © Springer Pub.

XQuery and other high-level query languages for XML documents are not yet implemented by commercial products. Yet many browsers have already built-in XSLT support for transforming XML documents. XSLT is a standard way of performing structural rearrangement or presentational transformation of XML documents, but formulating complex queries is, compared to XQuery, difficult and errorprone. If XQuery expressions could be translated into XSLT (e.g. by a translator written in Java or XSLT itself), the benefits of XQuery would be immediately available to a wide range of commercial products. This paper introduces a process for translating queries formulated in XQuery syntax into XSL stylesheets. The process is described independently from a particular implementation by means of an ASM (Abstract State Machine). The ASM traverses the parse tree of a particular query and translates each node into corresponding XSLT commands. The result of this translation process is an XSL stylesheet that can be applied to an XML document in order to perform the given query. The presented ASM can be easily coded in Java or XSLT to implement a prototype XQ2XSL translator. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",,High level languages; Information systems; Information use; Java programming language; Query languages; Semantics; XML; Abstract state machines; Commercial products; Complex queries; High-level queries; Structural rearrangement; Translation process; Www consortiums; XQuery expressions; Translation (languages),,,,,,,"Compilers Principles Techniques and Tools, (1986); Lncs, (2000); Query Language Position Paper of the Xsl, (1998); Science of Computer Programming, (1994); Formal Syntax and Semantics of Java, (1998); Extensible Markup Language Xml 1 0, (2000); Buneman, Peter, A Query Language and Optimization Techniques for Unstructured Data, SIGMOD Record, 25, 2, pp. 505-516, (1996); Lecture Notes in Computer Science, (2000); Xsl Transformations Xslt Version 1 0, (1999); New Yatl Design and Specifications, (1999)",,"Arisawa, H.; Kambayashi, Y.; Kumar, V.; Mayr, H.C.; Hunt, I.",Springer Verlag,DAMA International,"20th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, ER 2001 associated with International Workshop on Conceptual Modeling of Human/Organizational/Social Aspects of Manufacturing Activities, HUMACS 2001, International Workshop on Data Semantics in Web Information Systems, DASWIS 2001, 2nd International Workshop on Conceptual Modeling Approaches for e-Business, ECOMO 2001 and International Workshop on Global Data Modeling in the New Millennium, DAMA 2001",2001-11-27 through 2001-11-30,Yokohama,122249,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

This level of composition so-called ""Process Level"" considers web services with their internal and complex behaviors. At process level formal models such as State Transition Systems (STS from now) or Interface Automata are the most appropriate models to represent the internal behavior of stateful web services. However such models focus only on semantics of their behaviors and unfortunately not on semantics of actions and their parameters. In this paper, we suggest to extend the STS model, by following the WSMO based annotation for Abstract State Machine. This semantic enhancement of STS so called S2TS will enable to model semantics of internal behaviors and semantics of their actions together with their input and output parameters. Secondly, we will focus on automated generation of data flow (or the process to perform automated assignments between parameter of services involved in a composition). Thus we do not restrict to assignments of exact parameters (which is practically never used in industrial scenario) but extend assignments to semantically close parameters (e.g., through a subsumption matching) in the same ontology. Our system is implemented and interacting with web services dedicated to Telecommunication scenarios.

The composition of multiple parties ' business processes is always done with a specific objective in mind. Not only in the positive case, but also if the objective of a business process can not be fulfilled, all participating business processes need to be in some expected recovery state. We propose a composition algorithm solving the task of designing a collaborative business process while respecting a set of primary and recovery goals. In our model, each business process is described as a finite state machine. The multiplication of all business processes in one single model of possible executions would lead to an explosion of the number of states. Therefore, our composition algorithm directly interprets the multiple finite state machine (FSM) representations and creates a collaborative business process without integrating all FSMs into a single FSM upfront. Our composition algorithm returns an orchestration of the given business processes only in the case that it can be assured that each execution only leads to an expected primary or recovery goal. In order to prove our concepts, we first mathematically define the execution of business processes and orchestrations by providing abstract state machine (ASM) representations for them. Second, we execute the ASMs in the execution engine CoreASM which shows that the generated orchestration steers the execution of the business processes as intended. © 2007 IEEE.",,Abstracting; Boolean functions; Contour followers; Decentralized control; Finite automata; Lead; Metal recovery; Recovery; Structure (composition); Web services; Abstract State Machine (ASM); Business goals; Business processes (BP); Business processing; Collaborative business processes; Composition algorithm; execution engines; Finite State Machine (FSM); In order; Multiple parties; Number of states; Process engineering,,,,,,,"Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Proc of the 12th Int L Workshop on Abstract State Machines, (2005); Uml V 2 0 Specification, (2003); Pistore, Marco, Automated composition of web services by planning at the knowledge level, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1252-1259, (2005); Rao, Jinghai, A survey of automated Web service composition methods, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3387, pp. 43-54, (2005)","J.

Semantically, ambiguities can cause a lot of problems during the lifespan of a business process. As Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are grounded to subject orientation, we have explored their capabilities with respect to representing and executing Subject-oriented BPM (S-BPM) models. Based on the ASM method we implemented an interpreter which allows not only the proof of the S-BPM concept in terms of semantical preciseness, but also the automated execution of S-BPM models in terms of a workflow engine. This workflow engine serves as a baseline and reference implementation for further language and processing developments, such as simulation tools, as it has been developed within the Open-S-BPM initiative. This contribution focuses more on the use of the technique than on formal definitions. © The Author(s) 2015.",Business Process; Business Process Management; Modeling Business Process; Outgoing Edge; Transition Rule,Administrative data processing; Engines; Information management; Model checking; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Business Process; Business process management; Modeling business process; Outgoing edge; Process management; Subject-oriented; Transition rule; Enterprise resource management,,,,,,,"Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999); Börger, Egon, The ASM Refinement Method, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 2-3, pp. 237-257, (2003); A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Farahbod, Roozbeh, CoreASM: An extensible ASM execution engine, Fundamenta Informaticae, 77, 1-2, pp. 71-103, (2007); Fleischmann, Albert, What is S-BPM?, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 85 CCIS, pp. 85-106, (2010); Fleischmann, Albert, Subject-oriented business process management, pp. 1-375, (2012); Fleischmann, Albert, Whom to talk to?

As such, they can perform arbitrary actions on arbitrary objects. Abstract State Machines (ASMs) work on a similar basis. Exploring their capabilities with respect to representing and executing S-BPM models strengthens the theoretical foundations of S-BPM, and thus, validity of S-BPM tools. Moreover it enables coherent intertwining of business process modeling with executing of S-BPM representations. In this contribution we introduce the framework and roadmap tackling the exploration of the ASM approach in the context of S-BPM. We also report the major result, namely the implementation of an executable workflow engine with an Abstract State Machine interpreter based on an existing abstract interpreter model for S-BPM (applying the ASM refinement concept).

Translation validation is one approach for compiler verification. A common semantic framework to represent source and target language is needed and Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are a well suited and established method. In this paper we present a method to show correctness of instruction selection by performing fully automated simulation proofs over symbolic execution traces of state transformations using an automated first-order theorem prover. We applied this approach to an industrial-strength compiler and created the ASM models in such a way that we are able to reuse them to create a cycle-accurate simulator. To achieve fast simulation we compile the ASM models to C++ and present the compilation scheme in this paper. Finally we present our preliminary results which indicate that a unified ASM model is sufficient for proving correct instruction selection and generating efficient cycle-accurate simulators. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,Abstract state machines; Compiler verifications; Cycle-accurate simulators; Fast simulation; First-order; Instruction selection; Processor models; Safety-critical embedded systems; Semantic framework; State transformation; Symbolic execution; Target language; Theorem provers; Translation validation; Computer simulation; Semantics; Program compilers,,,,,,,"Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Proc of the 12th Int L Workshop on Abstract State Machines, (2005); Fraser, Christopher W., BURG: Fast Optimal Instruction Selection and Tree Parsing, SIGPLAN Notices (ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages), 27, 4, pp. 68-76, (1992); An Abstract State Machine Specification of the Dec Alpha Processor Family, (1995); Hoder, Kryštof, Interpolation and symbol elimination in vampire, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6173 LNAI, pp. 188-195, (2010); Pnueli, Amir, Translation validation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1384, pp. 151-165, (1998); Riazanov, Alexandre, The design and implementation of VAMPIRE, AI Communications, 15, 2, pp. 91-110, (2002); Teich, Jürgen, Description and simulation of microprocessor instruction sets using ASMs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1912 LNCS, pp. 266-286, (2000); Zimmermann, Wolf, On the construction of correct compiler back-ends: An ASM approach, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 3, 5, pp. 504-567, (1997)","R.

Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. © 2007 IEEE.",,Algorithms; Automata theory; Branch and bound method; Circuit simulation; Computational complexity; Decision trees; Abstract State Machines (ASM); Bounded model checking; Symbolic Trajectory Evaluation (STE); Model checking,,,,,,,"Aït Mohamed, Otmane, MDG-based verification by retiming and combinational transformations, Proceedings of the IEEE Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI, pp. 356-361, (1998); Aït Mohamed, Otmane, On the non-termination of MDG-based abstract state enumeration, Theoretical Computer Science, 300, 1-3, pp. 161-179, (2003); Bryant, Randal E., Formal verification of digital circuits using symbolic ternary system models, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 531 LNCS, pp. 33-43, (1991); Bryant, Randal E., Symbolic simulation--Techniques and applications, pp. 517-521, (1990); Corella, Francisco, Multiway Decision Graphs for Automated Hardware Verification, Formal Methods in System Design, 10, 1, pp. 7-46, (1997); Pandey, Manish, Formal verification of PowerPCTM arrays using symbolic trajectory evaluation, pp. 649-654, (1996); Seger, Carl Johan H., Formal verification by symbolic evaluation of partially-ordered trajectories, Formal Methods in System Design, 6, 2, pp. 147-189, (1995); undefined, (2007)","L.

It has been shown that MapReduce is an example for the use of the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) bridging model, a model for parallel computation on a fixed set of processors comprising alternating computation and communication phases. In this article we extend the normal execution of MapReduce from processing large finite data sets to processing stream queries with input data stream assumed to continue indefinitely. We classify stream queries into three classes, memoryless, semi-memoryless and memorable, and provide the model for each class using MapReduce based on BSP. In addition, as some stream queries require large amounts of computing sources, the BSP computation model is extended to a model with unbounded many agents, but preserving the barrier synchronization. A behavioral theory is developed for this model extending the behavioral theory of the BSP model. This comprises an axiomatization, the definition of Infinite-Agent BSP abstract state machines (Inf-Ag-BSP-ASM) and the proof that such ASMs capture the unbounded synchronized computations. Finally, we show how MapReduce processing can be further improved on grounds of the unbounded extension. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Behavioral theory; Concurrent ASM; Infinite-agent BSP model; MapReduce; Stream query,Computation theory; Silver compounds; Synchronization; Abstract state machines; Barrier synchronization; Behavioral theory; Bulk synchronous parallel; Communication phasis; Computation model; Computing sources; Parallel Computation; Data streams,,,,,,,"Blass, Andreas R., Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 4, 4, pp. 578-651, (2003); Blass, Andreas R., Program termination and well partial orderings, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 9, 3, (2008); Börger, Egon, Concurrent abstract state machines, Acta Informatica, 53, 5, pp. 469-492, (2016); Börger, Egon, A Behavioural Theory of Recursive Algorithms, Fundamenta Informaticae, 177, 1, pp. 1-37, (2020); Gil-Costa, Verónica, A parallel search engine with BSP, 2005, pp. 259-268, (2005); Dean, Jeffrey, MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters, pp. 137-149, (2004); Dershowitz, Nachum, On the parallel computation thesis, Logic Journal of the IGPL, 24, 3, pp. 346-374, (2016); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A new thesis concerning synchronised parallel computing – simplified parallel ASM thesis, Theoretical Computer Science, 649, pp. 25-53, (2016); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, BSP abstract state machines capture bulk synchronous parallel computations, Science of Computer Programming, 184, (2019); Gava, Frédéric, A BSP algorithm for on-the-fly checking CTL* formulas on security protocols, Journal of Supercomputing, 69, 2, pp. 629-672, (2014)","K.-D.

Unfortunately, many of them do not use standardized communication protocols with a provable security guarantee. The use of formal methods is, therefore, highly demanded in order to perform property verification and to prevent possible threats and accidents to users. In this paper, we propose a formal verification of the Z-Wave protocol, claimed to be one of the most secure IoT communication protocols thanks to the new S2 Security class, recently added. Specifically, our analysis targets the joining procedure of a device to the Z-Wave net. We exploit the ASMETA formal framework to model the protocol and to perform formal analysis in terms of model validation against informal documented requirements and verification of the protocol correct behaviour with respect to its security goals.

The development processes of DSLs using it can be divided into two phases: the first phase is to define and specify concepts which are basic units of DSLs; the second phase is to assemble DSLs with the concepts. The two phases are independent; therefore, a DSL can be implemented by domain experts and language experts together. on the basis of this idea, a metalanguage, DD, is defined for specifying DSLs. Each concept is defined as an independent module, which can help to improve the reusability of the DSLs developments. The concepts of the DSLs are divided into two kinds: element concepts and complement concepts, which makes the definitions of DSLs more flexible.

A DSL is composed of concepts, including common language concepts and domain concepts. From the functionality point of view, concepts can be divided into two kinds: element concepts and complement concepts. Element concepts capture the basic functions of a DSL, and complement concepts define some auxiliary functions for a DSL. Because extended attribute grammar and evolving algebra are used to specify the semantics of element concepts, the descriptions are formal, yet easily understood. Transformation rules are used to specify the semantics of complement concepts. In order to improve the reusability, element and complement concepts are defined at a high abstract level, and they are defined as some independent components. The definition of a new DSL follows two steps: defining element and complement concepts separately; instantiating concepts and assembling them.

Models that compute these functions are called Turing-complete. For example, we know that common imperative languages (such as C, Ada or Python) are Turing complete (up to unbounded memory). Algorithmic completeness is a stronger notion than Turing-completeness. It focuses not only on the input-output behavior of the computation but more importantly on the step-by-step behavior. Moreover, the issue is not limited to partial recursive functions, it applies to any set of functions. A model could compute all the desired functions, but some algorithms (ways to compute these functions) could be missing (see [10, 27] for examples related to primitive recursive algorithms). This paper's purpose is to prove that common imperative languages are not only Turing-complete but also algorithmically complete, by using the axiomatic definition of the Gurevich's Thesis and a fair bisimulation between the Abstract State Machines of Gurevich (defined in [16]) and a version of Jones' While programs.

It provides a conceptual bridge between the physical implementation of the machine and the abstraction available to a programmer, while having portable and scalable performance predictions of BSP algorithms on most HPC systems. Two questions may come to mind. What are formally BSP algorithms? And how to ensure that the programmer can effectively program every BSP algorithm with a BSP language, especially with the right cost? Gurevich proved that three convincing postulates for the sequential algorithms are equivalent to what is called Abstract State Machines (ASMs ), and thus that ASMs capture the sequential algorithms. Firstly, we extend these sequential postulates and ASMs in order to intuitively and realistically capture the BSP algorithms (and not more). Secondly, by using an operational semantics and an algorithmic simulation, we prove that [Formula presented] is equivalent to [Formula presented], a minimal imperative BSP programming language. Therefore, BSP programming languages (extending at least [Formula presented]) are BSP algorithmically complete, involving the definition of a class model of the BSP algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Algorithmic completeness; ASM; Axiomatization; BSP; Semantics,Computer simulation languages; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Algorithmic completeness; Axiomatization; Bulk synchronous parallel; High performance computing; Operational semantics; Scalable performance; Sequential algorithm; Algorithmic languages,,,,,,,"Gorlatch, Sergei P., Send-Receive Considered Harmful: Myths and Realities of Message Passing, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 26, 1, pp. 47-56, (2004); Dean, Jeffrey, Map Reduce: A flexible data processing tool, Communications of the ACM, 53, 1, pp. 72-77, (2010); Cappello, Franck, On communication determinism in parallel HPC applications, Proceedings - International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, ICCCN, (2010); González–Vélez, Horacio, A survey of algorithmic skeleton frameworks: High-level structured parallel programming enablers, Software - Practice and Experience, 40, 12, pp. 1135-1160, (2010); Vardi, Moshe Y., What is an algorithm?, Communications of the ACM, 55, 3, (2012); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000); Mathematics Unlimited 2001 and Beyond, (2001); Journal of Symbolic Logic, (1989); Berry, Gérard, Sequential algorithms on concrete data structures, Theoretical Computer Science, 20, 3, pp. 265-321, (1982); Biedl, Therese C., Palindrome recognition using a multidimensional tape, Theoretical Computer Science, 302, 1-3, pp. 475-480, (2003)","F.

Evolving algebras provide a formal method for executable specifications which has been employed for specifying several algorithms and programming languages. With its transition system-like rule-based syntax, the concept is as well very intuitive as well-suited for formal reasoning and verification. Following the need for structuring capabilities in specification frameworks, the paper proposes a concept for hierarchically structuring Evolving Algebras corresponding to the semantics of the system to be modeled, allowing to build up complex systems from simpler ones by several combinators. The concept can be~generalized to arbitrary rule-based stateoriented formalisms. In such systems, transitions regarded as atomic on the corresponding level are allowed to be specified by computations performed by sub- Evolving-Algebras instead of single rules. The subsystems provide a natural way of encapsulating data and behaviour while a computation is running. Communication is done via distinguished locations accessible to the participating systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.",,Algebra; Computation theory; Data encapsulation; Formal specification; Semantics; Combinators; Executable specifications; Formal reasoning; Participating systems; Single-rule; Specification frameworks; Structured systems; Transition system; Software design,,,,,,,"Aceto, Luca, Towards action-refinement in process algebras, Information and Computation, 103, 2, pp. 204-269, (1993); Alur, Rajeev, Reactive modules, Proceedings - Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 207-218, (1996); Occam Specification and Compiler Correctness, (1994); Bergstra, Jan A., Module Algebra, Journal of the ACM, 37, 2, pp. 335-372, (1990); Bonner, Anthony J., An overview of transaction logic, Theoretical Computer Science, 133, 2, pp. 205-265, (1994); Lean Ea A Poor S Man S Evolving Algebra Compiler, (1995); Logic Programming Formal Methods and Practical Applications, (1994); Degano, Pierpaolo, Atomic refinement in process description languages, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 520 LNCS, pp. 121-130, (1991); Degano, Pierpaolo, A causal operational semantics of action refinement, Information and Computation, 122, 1, pp. 97-119, (1995); Proc Accolade95, (1995)","W.

Customizable language dictionary and customizable notations of the model elements offered by domain-specific technologies make software systems easier to create and maintain. However, visual model definitions have a tendency to be incomplete, or imprecise; the definitions can be extended by textual constraints attached to the model items. Textual constraints can eliminate the incompleteness stemming from the limitations of the structural definition as well. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is one of the most popular constraint languages in the field of UML and Domain Specific Modeling Languages. OCL is a flexible, yet formal language with a mathematical background. Existing formalisms of OCL does not describe dynamic behavior of constraints. Our research aims at creating an OCL optimization solution and prove its correctness formally. However, the shortcomings of the existing formalism has led us to create a new formalism. The paper presents OCLASM, a new formalism for OCL, which can describe both the semantics and the dynamical behavior of the language constructs, thus, it is capable of describing proofs of optimization algortihms.

LFA achieves this by delegating a given task to either the prover or the flow analysis depending on which is best suited to discharge it. Described within are a concrete semantics for continuation-passing style; a restricted, first-order logic; a woven product of two abstract interpretations; proofs of correctness; and a worked example.

Predicting their reliability is very important to appropriately drive the selection and assembly of services, to evaluate design feasibility, to compare design alternatives, to identify potential failure areas and to maintain an acceptable reliability level under environmental extremes. This article presents a model for predicting reliability of a service-oriented application based on its architecture specification in the lightweight formal language SCA-ASM. The SCA-ASM component model is based on the OASIS standard Service Component Architecture for heterogeneous service assembly and on the formal method Abstract State Machines for modeling service behavior, interactions, and orchestration in an abstract but executable way. The proposed method provides an automatic and compositional means for predicting reliability both at system-level and component-level by combining a reliability model for an SCA assembly involving SCA-ASM components, and a reliability model of an SCA-ASM component. It exploits ideas from architecture-based and path-based reliability models. A set of experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its comparison with a state-of-the art BPEL-based approach. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Abstract State Machines; Service Component Architecture; Software reliability models,,,,,,,,"Abdelmoez, W.

In this paper, we describe the adoption of Abstract States Machines (ASMs) as a specification methodology for the description of learning processes in FLOSS. The goal of this endeavor is to represent the many possible steps and/or activities FLOSS participants go through during interactions that can be categorized as learning processes.

Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation.

We assume that a model of the nondeterministic system is given by a directed graph with two kind of vertices: states and choice points. Choice points represent the nondeterministic behaviour of the implementation under test (IUT). Edges represent transitions. They have costs and probabilities. Test case generation in this setting amounts to generation of a game strategy. The two players are the testing tool (TT) and the IUT. The game explores the graph. The TT leads the IUT by selecting an edge at the state vertices. At the choice points the control goes to the IUT. A game strategy decides which edge should be taken by the TT in each state. This paper presents three novel algorithms 1) to determine an optimal strategy for the bounded reachability game, where optimality means maximizing the probability to reach any of the given final states from a given start state while at the same time minimizing the costs of traversal; 2) to determine a winning strategy for the bounded reachability game, which guarantees that given final vertices are reached, regardless how the IUT reacts; 3) to determine a fast converging edge covering strategy, which guarantees that the probability to cover all edges quickly converges to 1 if TT follows the strategy.

G.Hari, Vanderbilt University School of Engineering, Nashville, TN, United States; Karsai, Gábor, Vanderbilt University School of Engineering, Nashville, TN, United States","Graph transformation is often used to transform domain models from one domain specific language (DSML) to another. In some cases, the DSMLs are based on a formalism that has many implementation variants, such as Statecharts. For instance, it could be necessary to transform iLogix Statechart models into Matlab Stateflow models. The preservation of behavior of the models is crucial in such transformations. Bisimulation has previously been demonstrated as an approach to verifying behavior preservation, and semantic anchoring is an approach to specifying the dynamic semantics of DSMLs. We propose a method to verify behavior preservation, using bisimulation in conjunction with semantic anchoring. We will consider two hypothetical variants of the Statecharts formalism, and specify the operational semantics of each variant by semantic anchoring, using Abstract State Machines as a common semantic framework. We then establish bisimulation properties to verify if the behavior models of the source and target Statechart models are equivalent for a particular execution of the transformation. © 2006 Universitatsbibliothek TU Berlin.",Behavior preservation; Bisimulation; Semantic anchoring,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0509098)","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0509098.

Thus, the aim of this work is to present a general approach for actor modelling in business processes that supports different layers of abstraction, thereby increasing the expressiveness and avoiding inaccuracy and redundancy. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed actor modelling approach supports task-based assignment of actors and roles based on deontic logic and speech act theory. The semantics of the approach is formally specified based on abstract state machines. Findings: The new approach for actor modelling is more expressive and provides the possibility to reduce the structural complexity of the process flow as shown by a case study and a comparison of an ordinary business process modelling approach using swimlanes and the actor modelling approach based on the workflow resource patterns. In particular, the evaluation showed that important patterns such as separation of duties and retain familiar are only supported by the actor modelling approach. Research limitations/implications: The research is to some degree in the context of the business process model and notation as a representative of a business process modelling language using swimlanes.

A drawback of BPMN, however, is that modality is implicitly expressed through the structure of the process flow but not directly within the corresponding activity. Thus, an extension of BPMN with deontic logic has been proposed in previous work, called Deontic BPMN. Deontic BPMN reduces the structural complexity of the process flow and increases the readability by explicitly highlighting obligatory and permissible activities. In addition, an algebraic graph transformation from a subset of BPMN to Deontic BPMN, called Deontic BpmnGTS, has been defined. The goal of the current research is to show that DeonticBpmnGTS is terminating and confluent, resulting in a globally deterministic transformation. Moreover, the semantic equivalence of BPMN models and the respective Deontic BPMN models is proven based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Thus, DeonticBpmnGTS can be called a trusted model transformation. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",BPMN; Business process modelling; Deontic logic; Deterministic transformation; Graph transformation; Semantic analysis,Graph theory; Process engineering; Systems engineering; BPMN; Business process modelling; Deontic Logic; Deterministic transformation; Graph Transformation; Semantic analysis; Semantics,,,,,"European Regional Development Fund, ERDF",The project Vertical Model Integration is supported within the program “Regionale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit OÖ 2007–2013” by the European Fund for Regional Development as well as the State of Upper Austria.,"van der Aalst, Wil M.P., Workflow patterns, Distributed and Parallel Databases, 14, 1, pp. 5-51, (2003); undefined; undefined; Proceedings Variability Modelling of Software Intensive Systems Vamos 2009, (2009); Proceedings 4th International Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software Intensive Systems Vamos 10, (2010); Handbook of Conceptual Modeling Theory Practice and Research Challenges, (2011); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Börger, Egon, A method for verifiable and validatable business process modeling, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5316 LNCS, pp. 59-115, (2008); Tutorial for Esslli, (2010); Informatik Systemstrukturen Und Theoretische Informatik 2, (1998)",,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,,,,,16191366,,,,English,Softw.

While the underlying platforms guarantee the correctness of smart-contract execution, they cannot ensure that the code of a contract is correct. Today, as evidenced by a number of recent security breaches, developers still have a hard time making contracts that work properly.Even though these incidents often exploit contract interaction, prior work on smart-contract verification, vulnerability discovery, and secure development typically considers only individual contracts in isolation. To address this gap, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a abstract state machine based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify the behavior of a set of interacting contracts at a high level of abstraction. VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code that is functionally and behaviorally equivalent to verified models, which enables the creation of correct-by-design smart contracts. We additionally introduce a graphical notation (called deployment diagrams) for specifying possible interactions between contract types. Based on this notation, we present a framework for the automated verification, generation, and deployment of contracts that conform to a deployment diagram. To demonstrate the applicability of VeriSolid, we translate existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) specifications to temporal properties for two of the most popular contract interfaces: ERC20 and ERC721. We also show you how to write code for the ERC20 and ERC721 interfaces in a way that is safe, and we do this by using VeriSolid. We evaluate our framework on 726 contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, which include 267 ERC20 and 459 ERC721 contracts. Our experiments indicate that 18% of ERC20 contracts and 4% of ERC721 contracts fail to satisfy the EIP specifications. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",EIP; ERC20; ERC721; ethereum; Smart contracts; solidity; verification,Behavioral research; Blockchain; Codes (symbols); Ethereum; Formal verification; Semantics; Specifications; Behavioral science; Block-chain; Code; Deployment diagrams; ERC20; Erc721; Ethereum improvement proposal; Security; Solid modelling; Solidity; Smart contract,,,,,,,"A 50 Million Hack Just Showed that the Dao Was all Too Human, (2016); Wired, (2017); He, Daojing, Smart Contract Vulnerability Analysis and Security Audit, IEEE Network, 34, 5, pp. 276-282, (2020); Ethereum A Secure Decentralised Generalised Transaction Ledger, (2014); Mavridou, Anastasia, VeriSolid: Correct-by-Design Smart Contracts for Ethereum, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11598 LNCS, pp. 446-465, (2019); Clarke, Edmund Melson, Model Checking and Abstraction, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 16, 5, pp. 1512-1542, (1994); Etherscan, (2020); Workshop on Logics of Programs, (1981); Correct by Design Interacting Smart Contracts and A Systematic Approach for Verifying Erc20 and Erc721 Contracts with Verisolid, (2022); Basu, Ananda, Rigorous component-based system design using the BIP framework, IEEE Software, 28, 3, pp. 41-48, (2011)","K.

Their composition and deployment come in different solutions tailored to users requests based on business models, functionality, quality of service, cost, and value. Bridging different parts into one software solution is brittle due to issues like heterogeneity, complexity, lack of transparency, network and communication failures, and misbehavior. The current paper proposes a decision-based solution for the dynamic adaptation part of a middleware which addresses the aforementioned problems for large-scale distributed systems. The envisioned architecture is built on case-based reasoning principles and stands at the base of the adaptation processes that are imperative for ensuring the delivery of high-quality software. The solution is further extended through ground models with a focus on reliability, availability of components, and failure tolerance in terms of abstract state machines.

The definition proposed in this paper is based on the runtime semantics of distributed systems. Rather than attempt to simply compare static characteristics of Grids and other distributed computing environments, this paper analyzes operational differences, from the viewpoint of an application executing in both environments.

They combine advantages of informal and formal methods. Applications of this method motivate a number of computability and decidability problems connected to ASMs. Such problems result for example from the area of verifying properties of ASMs. Their high expressive power leads rather directly to undecidability respectively uncomputability results for most interesting problems in the case of unrestricted ASMs. Consequently, it is rather natural to ask whether there exist expressive classes of ASMs for which we can prove positive decidability and computability results. In this work, we introduce such a class of ASMs. The concept is similar to the one of the guarded fragment of first-order logic. We analyze the expressive power of this class and prove that it is stronger than Datalog LITE and the guarded fragment of first-order fixed point logic.

The idea of this concept is analogous to the one of program slicing which is an established technique for extracting statements from a program that are relevant for its behaviour at a given point of interest. These statements form again a syntactically correct program called a slice. Previous work has focused on programming languages that differ substantially from ASMs. Although the concept of program slicing does not directly extend to ASMs, it is possible to find an analogous concept for ASMs, We present such an approach. In spite of the fact that a minimal slice is not computable in the general case, we identify an expressive class of ASMs for which a minimal (static) slice is computable (and prove the computability). This basic result can be extended in several ways.

Because of undecidability in the general case, one has to identify classes of ASMs and classes of properties in order to receive positive decidability results. One idea for this could be to put simple restrictions on the ASMs as forbidding certain advanced constructs. But it turns out that this does not help much. Additionally, the restrictions in those cases are very strong. Consequently, one has to look for others. Such restrictions may result from techniques which are intended to be used in the proofs of decidability. One proof technique is the reduction to a decidable reasoning problem in logic. In [8] and [10], this has been applied to receive some positive decidability results. In this paper, we identify further classes of ASMs and classes of properties for which the general verification problem is decidable.

This paper presents an approach to define an executable semantics for UML that would enable tool vendors to build intelligent tools (symbolic execution, consistency checkers, etc.). We use Abstract State Machines (ASM) as underlying formalism for our semantics definition, which is composed of static semantics and dynamic semantics. A part of the static semantics was done by expressing in ASM the UML meta-model and well formedness rules defined in the UML standard. The dynamic semantics is based on a set of behaviour primitives (time, communication, etc). We define the ASM transition rules corresponding to UML actions.

In the engineering of embedded real-time systems, the correctness of the system is defined in terms of three aspects - function, time, and resource consumption. The goal of the TASM language and its associated toolset is to provide a basis for specification-based real-time system engineering where these three aspects can be specified and analyzed. The TASM language is built on top of Abstract State Machines (ASM) by including facilities for compact and legible specification of non-functional behavior, namely time and resource consumption. The TASMlanguage provides a notation which is well-suited to the specification needs of embedded real-time systems. We begin the presentation of the language with a historical survey on the use of ASM in specifying real-time systems. The core difference between the TASM language and ASM is that steps are inherently durative instead of being instantaneous and steps consume resources. These concepts capture the reality of physical systems in a flexible abstract model.

Custom algorithms to verify these properties automatically have been devised for a number of specification languages, including SCR, RSML, and Statecharts. In this paper, we provide means to automatically verify completeness and consistency of Abstract State Machine (ASM) specifications. The verification is performed using a widely available tool, a SAT solver. The use of a SAT solver removes the need for designing and fine tuning language specific verification algorithms. Furthermore, the use of a SAT solver automates the verification procedure and produces a counterexample automatically when a specification is incomplete or inconsistent. We provide an algorithm to translate ASM specifications to a SAT problem instance. The translation is illustrated using the TASM toolset in conjunction with the ""production cell system"" case study. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In real-time systems, quantitative values of time, as reflected through the duration of actions, are central to the system's correctness. We review basic time concepts and explain how time is handled in different modeling languages. We expose the inherent paradox of incorporating quantitative time-dependent behavior in high-level models. High-level models are typically built before the system is implemented, which makes quantitative time metrics difficult to predict since these metrics depend heavily on implementation details. We provide some possible answers to this paradox and explain how the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language helps address some of these issues. © 2007 IEEE.",,Machine oriented languages; Mathematical models; Real time systems; Software design; Quantitative time metrics; Software systems; Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM); Computer hardware,,,,,,,"Abdeddaïm, Yasmina, Task graph scheduling using timed automata, (2003); Alur, Rajeev, A theory of timed automata, Theoretical Computer Science, 126, 2, pp. 183-235, (1994); Behrmann, Gerd, A Tutorial on UPPAAL, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3185, pp. 200-236, (2004); Systems and Software Verification Model Checking Techniques and Tools, (2001); Software Engineering Economics, (1981); Software Design, (2003); Cerone, Antonio, Time-based expressivity of time Petri nets for system specification, Theoretical Computer Science, 216, 1-2, pp. 1-53, (1999); Cheng, Albert Mo Kim, Real-Time Systems: Scheduling, Analysis, and Verification, pp. 1-524, (2003); Dave, Bharat P., COSYN: hardware-software co-synthesis of embedded systems, pp. 703-708, (1997); undefined, (2007)","M.

We defined three design steps where we first model the bus in UML; then, design it completely with Abstract State Machines (ASM); and, finally, translate the ASM code to SystemC. We considered an intermediate ASM representation in order to extract the finite state machine of the bus that can be used to for model checking of PSL properties. The final SystemC monitor block can be seen as a stand-alone PCI IP as well as a verification module to validate other SystemC PCI compatible devices.

Manual test writing or automated random test generation techniques are often used for such validation practices. However, directing tests to particular reachable states of a SystemC model is often difficult, especially when these models are large and complex. In this work, we present a model-driven methodology for generating directed tests that take the SystemC model under validation to specific reachable states. This allows the validation to uncover very specific scenarios which lead to different corner cases. Our formal modeling is done entirely within the Microsoft SpecExplorer tool to describe the specification of the system under validation in the notation of AsmL. We also exploit SpecExplorer's abilities for state space exploration for our test generations, and its APIs for connecting the model to implementation programs to drive the validation of SystemC models with the generated test cases.

The standard aims at the portability of control applications that is however hampered by ambiguities in its execution semantics descriptions. In recent years several execution models have been implemented in different software tools that generate mutually incompatible code. This paper proposes a general approach to neutralizing these semantic ambiguities by formal description of the IEC 61499 in abstract state machines (ASM). The model embodies all known execution semantics of function blocks. The ASM model is further translated to the input format of the SMV model-checker which is used to verify formally properties of applications. In this way the proposed verification framework enables the portability checking of component-based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The paper first discusses different existing execution semantics of function blocks and the portability issues across different IEC 61499 tools. Then a modular formal model of function blocks’ operational semantics in ASM is introduced and exemplified in the paper by the cyclic execution semantics case for a composite function block. Subsequently, the SMV model is generated and model-checking is illustrated for a simple test case. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",Abstract state machines; Formal semantics; Formal verification; IEC 61499; Model checking,Computer aided software engineering; Embedded systems; Formal methods; Formal verification; Information science; Semantics; Standards; Abstract state machines; Component-based control; Distributed embedded control system; Executable components; Formal Semantics; IEC 61499; Implementation platforms; Verification framework; Model checking,,,,,,,"undefined, (2012); Vyatkin, Valeriy V., IEC 61499 as enabler of distributed and intelligent automation: State-of-the-art review, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 7, 4, pp. 768-781, (2011); Vyatkin, Valeriy V., The IEC 61499 standard and its semantics, IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine, 3, 4, pp. 40-48, (2009); Formal Modelling and Verification of Iec61499 Function Blocks with Abstract State Machines and Smv the Cyclic Semantics Case, (2014); Čengič, Goran, On formal analysis of iec 61499 applications, part B: Execution semantics, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 6, 2, pp. 145-154, (2010); Čengič, Goran, On formal analysis of IEC 61499 applications, Part A: Modeling, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 6, 2, pp. 136-144, (2010); Dubinin, Victor, On definition of a formal model for IEC 61499 function blocks, Eurasip Journal on Embedded Systems, 2008, 1, (2008); undefined; Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, (1988); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995)",,"Virbitskaite, I.; Voronkov, A.; Virbitskaite, I.",Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,"9th International Ershov Informatics Conference on Perspectives of System Informatics, PSI 2014",2014-06-24 through 2014-06-27,St. Petersburg,142359,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

This paper proposes approach to formal modelling of IEC61499 function block execution semantics for popular model checking environment of SMV using Abstract State Machines. An operational semantics of IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model is presented using this framework. This paper first introduces the importance of model checking function block applications in different execution semantics. It highlights the uses of formal verification, such as, verifying portability (behavior) of component based control applications across different implementation platforms compliant with the IEC 61499 standard. The formal model is applied on an example IEC 61499 application. The paper compares the verification results of this IEC 61499 application with two-stage synchronous execution model and the same application with cyclic execution model presented in the earlier work. With this comparison, we verify the portability of the IEC61499 applications across different platforms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Abstract state machines; Formal semantics; Formal verification; IEC 61499; Model checking; Two-stage synchronous execution model,Application programs; Computer architecture; Formal verification; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Component-based control; Distributed embedded control system; Executable components; Execution model; Formal Semantics; IEC 61499; Implementation platforms; Model checking,,,,,,,"Vyatkin, Valeriy V., IEC 61499 as enabler of distributed and intelligent automation: State-of-the-art review, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 7, 4, pp. 768-781, (2011); Function Blocks Part 1 Architecture, (2005); 9th International Andrei Ershov Memorial Conference Psi 2014, (2014); Patil, Sandeep, Formal Verification of IEC61499 Function Blocks with Abstract State Machines and SMV-Modelling, 3, pp. 313-320, (2015); Dubinin, Victor, On definition of a formal model for IEC 61499 function blocks, Eurasip Journal on Embedded Systems, 2008, 1, (2008); Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, (1988); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Börger, Egon, A high-level modular definition of the semantics of C #, Theoretical Computer Science, 336, 2, pp. 235-284, (2005); Formal Semantics for VHDL, (1995); Glässer, Uwe, High-level executable specification of the universal plug and play architecture, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2002-January, pp. 3686-3695, (2002)","S.

By symbolically executing an ASM specification, certain properties can be checked by transforming the described ASM into a suitable input for model checkers or Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). Due to the rather fast increasing state space, model checking and ATP solutions can lead to inefficient implementations of symbolic execution. More efficient state space and execution performance can be achieved by using a concolic execution approach. In this paper, we describe an improved concolic execution implementation for the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language. We outline the transformation of a symbolically executed ASM specification to a single Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) format. Furthermore, we introduce a compiler analysis to promote concrete ASM functions into symbolic ones in order to obtain symbolic consistency. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Abstract State Machine; CASM; Concolic execution; TPTP; Z3,Formal specification; Theorem proving; Abstract state machines; Automated theorem prover; Compiler analysis; Concolic execution; Execution performance; Symbolic execution; Symbolic interpretation; Theorem provers; Model checking,,,,,,We would like to thank Andreas Krall1 for proof-reading the paper and Emmanuel Pescosta for several concolic execution discussions.,"Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018); 14th International ASM Workshop, (2007); undefined; Baldoni, Roberto, A survey of symbolic execution techniques, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 3, pp. 1-39, (2019); undefined; Lezuo, Roland, CASM - Optimized compilation of abstract state machines?, Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES), pp. 13-22, (2014); Sutcliffe, Geoff, The TPTP Problem Library and Associated Infrastructure: From CNF to TH0, TPTP v6.4.0, Journal of Automated Reasoning, 59, 4, pp. 483-502, (2017); Tacas 2008 Lncs; Lezuo, Roland, VanHelsing: A Fast Proof Checker for Debuggable Compiler Verification, pp. 167-174, (2015)","P.

Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications. Almost all built-in behaviors are implicitly defined inside a concrete ASM language implementation and thus, the behavior is hidden from the language user. In this paper, we present a new ASM syntax extension based on traits, which allows the specifier (language user) to define new type abstractions in the form of structure and behavior definitions to reuse, maintain, structure, and extend the functionality in ASM specifications. We describe the proposed language construct by defining its syntax and semantics. The decision to use a trait-based syntax extension over other object-oriented language constructs like interfaces or mixins was motivated and driven by the results of previously conducted empirical studies.

Over the past years, there have been many approaches to implement concrete ASM-based modeling and specification languages. All of those approaches define their type systems and operator semantics differently in their internal representation, which leads to undesired or unexpected behavior during the modeling, the execution, and code generation of such ASM specifications. In this paper, we present CASM-IR, an Intermediate Representation (IR), designed to aid ASM-based language engineering which is based on a well-formed ASM-based specification format. Moreover, CASM-IR is conceptualized from the ground up to ease the formalization of ASM-based analysis and transformation passes.

We report on a controlled experiment with 105 participants to study the understandability of the three language constructs in the context of ASMs. Our hypotheses are influenced by the debate of object-oriented communities. We hypothesized that the understandability (measured by correctness and duration variables) shows significantly better understanding for interfaces and traits compared to mixins, as well as at least a similar or better understanding for traits compared to interfaces. The results indicate that understandability of interfaces and traits show a similar good understanding, whereas mixins shows a poorer understanding.

Recent ASM languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a specific environment. In this work-in-progress paper we outline a modelbased transformation approach supporting (1) the specification of applications or systems using the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language and (2) retargeting those applications to different programming language and hardware target domains. An intermediate model is introduced, which not only captures software-based implementations, but also the generation of hardware-related code in the same model. This approach offers a new formal modeling perspective onto modular, reusable and retargetable software and hardware designs for the development of embedded systems. We provide a short overview of our CASM compiler design as well as the retargetable model-based approach to generate code for different target domains. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Computer software reusability; Computer systems programming; Embedded systems; Hardware; Modeling languages; Program translators; Reconfigurable hardware; Specifications; Abstract state machines; Compiler design; Intermediate model; Model based approach; Model based transformations; Software and hardwares; Target programming language; Work in progress; Formal methods,,,,,,,"Evolving Algebras 1993 Lipari Guide, (1995); Börger, Egon, The abstract state machines method for high-level system design and analysis, pp. 79-116, (2010); Lezuo, Roland, CASM: Implementing an abstract state machine based programming language, Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI), P-215, pp. 75-90, (2013); Lezuo, Roland, CASM-optimized compilation of Abstract State Machines, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, 49, 5, pp. 13-22, (2014); Gurevich, Yuri G., Semantic essence of asml: Extended abstract, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3188, pp. 240-259, (2004); Farahbod, Roozbeh, CoreASM: An extensible ASM execution engine, Fundamenta Informaticae, 77, 1-2, pp. 71-103, (2007); Lattner, Chris, LLVM: A compilation framework for lifelong program analysis & transformation, pp. 75-86, (2004)","P.

In order to provide the necessary confidence level, with regard to the respect of functional and non-functional properties, a system analysis that accounts for all possible execution paths must be performed. Symbolic execution has been successfully used to explore and analyze reachable system states. In this paper, we formally define a symbolic execution semantics for an abstract state machine based model. The unification of the update semantics redefined in terms of symbolic moves, enable us to achieve reacher methods for path condition resolution and ultimately better scalability of the execution. The goal of this paper is to provide a formal ground for the integration of symbolic execution in existing timing analysis frameworks based on abstract state machines that will facilitate the computability of the analysis tools. © 2017",,Embedded systems; Interactive computer systems; Model checking; Safety engineering; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Confidence levels; Critical properties; Execution paths; Hard real-time systems; Non functional properties; Symbolic execution; Update semantics; Real time systems,,,,,,,"undefined, (2009); undefined, (2008); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); undefined, (1995); King, James C., Symbolic Execution and Program Testing, Communications of the ACM, 19, 7, pp. 385-394, (1976); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2012); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2013)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,14746670; 24058971,9783902661869; 9788374810357; 8374810351; 9783902661463; 9783902661586; 9783902661906; 9783902661104; 9783902823007; 9783902823243; 9783902823106,,,English,IFAC-PapersOnLine,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031802306

Besides processor simulation, the goal of our model is to provide a base for worst-case execution time estimation, providing abstraction capabilities that enable the scaling of analysis. The main difference between our model and other ASM extensions is that we define time as a mean to enable time accurate runs and hierarchical abstraction levels of components, while staying the closest possible to the original ASM mathematical foundation. The model is also designed to dynamically choose a suited component definition in order to adapt to information precision on data values. The time extension helps modelling non-instantaneous actions, which is essential for real-time systems. Adaptable precision and separation of the analysis from the model of the processor will prove well suited for integration into a worst-case execution time estimation tool. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Abstract state machine; ASM; Cycle-accurate; Formal language; Hard real-time systems; Hardware modelling; Processor simulation; Time-accurate; WCET; Worst-case execution time,,,,,,,,"Artemov, Sergei N., Preface, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 162, 3, pp. 173-174, (2010); Beauquier, Danièle, A first order logic for specification of timed algorithms: Basic properties and a decidable class, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 113, 1-3, pp. 13-52, (2001); International Multiconference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, (2009); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Proc of the 6th Intern Conf on Computer Science and Information Technology Csit 2007 24 28 September 2007 Yerevan Armenia Organised by National Academy of Science of Armenia in Cooperation with Test Technology Technical Council of IEEE Computer Society National Academy of Science of Armenia, (2008); Eisinger, Jochen, Automatic identification of timing anomalies for cycle-accurate worst-case execution time analysis, 2006, pp. 13-18, (2006); ASM 2000, (2000); Graf, Susanne, Time in state machines, Fundamenta Informaticae, 77, 1-2, pp. 143-174, (2007); Gurevich, Yuri G., The railroad crossing problem: An experiment with instantaneous actions and immediate reactions, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1092, pp. 266-290, (1996); Huggins, James K., Specification and verification of pipelining in the ARM2 RISC microprocessor, ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems, 3, 4, pp. 563-580, (1998)","V.-A.

The different ways in which a system can operate are associated with different modes, and transitions link modes to form mode-machines. However, mode-machines need a precise semantics if they are to be used for specifying the behaviour of critical systems. This paper analyses the possible relationships between modes and states. A number of concurrent systems described using MASCOT are considered, and their mode-based behaviour is used to motivate the semantics of a new real-time mode-machine notation, RTMMs. It is argued that RTMMs should not behave like abstract state-machines. A list of concurrent transactions is associated with each RTMM mode, and a notation is given for specifying their timing properties. RTMM transactions need not terminate when the central mode-controller switches mode, thus capturing the asynchronous way in which large systems respond to mode changes. RTMMs are given a proof-theoretic semantics using many-sorted logic, extended with the RTL occurrence relation, Θ. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.",,Fault tolerance; Semantics; Abstract state machines; Concurrent systems; Concurrent transactions; Critical systems; Mode controller; Proof-theoretic semantics; Real time modes; Timing properties; Real time systems,,,,,,,"Software Engineering Journal, (1993); Aspects of Gradualistic Mode Transition Systems, (1995); Finite Transition Systems, (1994); Avnur, Arie, Finite State Machines for Real-Time Software Engineering, Computing and Control Engineering Journal, 1, 6, pp. 273-278, (1990); System Designers Software Technology Centre, (1987); Advances in Real Time Systems, (1994); Static Timing Analysis and Program Proof, (1995); Harel, David, Statecharts: a visual formalism for complex systems, Science of Computer Programming, 8, 3, pp. 231-274, (1987); Henzinger, Thomas A.A., Timed transition systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 600 LNCS, pp. 226-251, (1992); Introduction to Automata Theory Languages and Computation, (1979)","S.

All these languages focus on the distribution of computation, which is somewhat the same as concurrent computation. In addition, there is also the aspect of distribution of state, which is often neglected. Distribution of state is most commonly represented by communication between active agents. This paper argues that it is desirable to abstract from the communication and to consider abstract distributed state. This includes semantic handling of conflict resolution, e.g. in connection with data replication. The need for abstract distribution of state is discussed and a novel semantics for concurrency based on an abstract distributed state is presented. This semantics uses runs over so-called multistates, and hides the internal communication for replica handling. This way, distributed computation is described over an abstract memory model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",,Distributed computer systems; Semantics; Systems analysis; Abstract state machines; Concurrent computation; Conflict Resolution; Description languages; Distributed computations; Distributed Memory; Distributed state; Internal communications; Unified Modeling Language,,,,,,,"Apache Cassandra 2 0 Documentation; Semantics of Sequential and Parallel Programs, (1996); Börger, Egon, Concurrent abstract state machines, Acta Informatica, 53, 5, pp. 469-492, (2016); Börger, Egon, Communication in abstract state machines, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 23, 2, pp. 129-145, (2017); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A new thesis concerning synchronised parallel computing – simplified parallel ASM thesis, Theoretical Computer Science, 649, pp. 25-53, (2016); SIGACT News, (2002); 1st Edn, (2014); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000)","A.

Therefore, the software remains vulnerable to attacks which are handled by issuing patches or service packs by the software vendors. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to take security into consideration right from the very beginning of the software development process. However, most specification languages were not designed with an intention for specifying security requirements, and therefore, they lack some features to serve this purpose. As a result, we need suitable specification languages that can be used both for functional specification and security specification. We propose a formal extension of a popular specification language called AsmL (Abstract State Machine Language) for attack descriptions with a view to building secure software. We name the extended language AsmLSec. We present the details of AsmLSec syntax and semantics, describe how to model attacks using its constructs, and present the design and implementation of a compiler that generates attack signatures from the AsmLSec attack specifications.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are those kinds of monitoring tools that have gained a considerable amount of popularity. A number of specification-based IDSs have been proposed, where security requirements or attack scenarios are specified using some languages. Currently, attack specification languages are being deployed for describing security requirements. Use of two different languages for software specification and security specification invites a number of unwanted but complicated issues, such as duplication of requirements specification effort as well as the existence of redundant and conflicting requirements. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection technique that uses a formal software specification language called Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) for the specification of security requirements. We present a framework, and develop the algorithm for the IDS that interprets the AsmL attack scenario specifications in order to detect intrusions. Moreover, we discuss case studies where the presented intrusion detection system is used to detect attacks. © 2005 IEEE.",,Abstracting; Algorithms; Computer software; Computer viruses; Information management; Intrusion detection; Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL); Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS); Monitoring tools; Security requirements; Specification languages,,,,,,,"Proceedings of the Workshop on Specification and Automated Processing of Security Requirements, (2004); Devanbu, Prem Thomas, Software engineering for security: A roadmap, pp. 225-239, (2000); Abstract State Machine Language, (2003); Ilgun, Koral, State Transition Analysis: A Rule-Based Intrusion Detection Approach, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 21, 3, pp. 181-199, (1995); Sekar, R.

It integrates on an open platform a variety of tools covering the entire design cycle for distributed embedded systems. Abstract specifications are supported by the Abstract State Machine Workbench (ASM Workbench) from HNI which is a design environment of its own. The same is true for the SpecC environment from UCI that has been integrated as well. An alternative modeling tool is SEA from C-LAB which is based on Predicate/Transition nets. Design space exploration is carried out using the SSEA tool from ETH Zurich/Univ. Paderborn. With the aid of the CHaRy tool from C-LAB a partitioning based on precise timing calculations is carried out. It is closely interconnected to the STARC code generator for StateCharts from C-LAB. It generates code with guaranteed execution times. For processes running as software on programmable processors a dedicated RTOS is generated using the generator TEReCS based on a component library named DreaMS, both from HNI. Processes to be mapped on hardware are handled by the PMOSS tool from TU Dresden/Univ. Tubingen/Univ. Paderborn. In this paper aspects of modeling based on Pr/T-nets and aspects of the synthesis process for such models are discussed. The co-existence of asynchronous and synchronous modeling techniques is pointed out and synthesis methods for both modeling paradigms are discussed. © 2002 IEEE.",Application software; Design methodology; Embedded computing; Embedded system; Hardware; Real time systems; Software libraries; Software systems; Space exploration; Timing,Application programs; Computer hardware; Computer software; Design; Embedded systems; Hardware; Interactive computer systems; Object oriented programming; Real time systems; Space research; Synthesis (chemical); Design Methodology; Embedded computing; Software libraries; Software systems; Space explorations; Timing; C (programming language),,,,,,,"Proc IFIP Wg 10 3 Wg 10 5 Dipes 98 Schloss Eringerfeld Germany, (1998); Astair; Journal Informationstechnik Und Technische Informatik It Ti, (1999); Proc Fdl 99 Lyon France, (1999); Lncs; Proc 5th Interntl Workshop on Ams Magdeburg, (1998); Proc of the 15th IFAC Dccs Como Italy, (1998); Genrich, Helga J., System modelling with high-level Petri nets, Theoretical Computer Science, 13, 1, pp. 109-135, (1981); Harel, David, Statecharts: a visual formalism for complex systems, Science of Computer Programming, 8, 3, pp. 231-274, (1987); 1st Embedded System Conference, (1999)","F.J.

There are very good reasons for this and simply the existence of VHDL as standardized language had a major impact on the advance of high level design techniques. In this paper some ideas about specification and modelling techniques beyond VHDL currently carried out in the author's research group are discussed. One approach is to integrate formal specification techniques like Evolving Algebras (EA) and Z into a VHDL-oriented design environment. Other approaches concentrate on the potential of visual modelling techniques.

ASMs gained much attention as a specification method. It is extremely flexible because any mathematical structure may serve as a state. Gurevich characterized the expressive power of ASMs in terms of intuitively convincing postulates. The core result of this paper shows that the next-state function M of an Abstract State Machine M can be described on a symbolic level, notwithstanding the generality of the model: The successor state M (S) of a state S is fully specified by the equivalence ∼<inf>S</inf> induced by S on the terms over the signature of M. Consequently, M (S) is computable in case ∼<inf>S</inf> is decidable.

So, many real usage scenarios might be impossible to reproduce and validate at design-time. As envisioned by the Models@run.time research community, the use of models at runtime is fundamental to address this challenge. Our focus is on providing guarantees for changing safety goals at runtime (a form of uncertainty) with the employment of mathematically-based runtime analysis techniques from the area of formal methods (FM@run.time). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the runtime simulation of Abstract State Machine models and the on-the-fly changes of safety assertions at the model level to provide software assurance guarantees at runtime. The framework is called AsmetaS@run.time and is being developed as part of the ASM specification and analysis toolset ASMETA. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Abstract State Machines; ASMETA; Models@run.time; Runtime simulation,Formal methods; Software architecture; Uncertainty analysis; Abstract state machines; Model-based simulations; Models at run time; Research communities; Resource availability; Run-time analysis; Run-time simulations; Software assurance; Computer software,,,,,,,"Safety Management Requirements for Defence Systems, (2007); Alemzadeh, Homa, Analysis of safety-critical computer failures in medical devices, IEEE Security and Privacy, 11, 4, pp. 14-26, (2013); Arcaini, Paolo, CoMA: Conformance monitoring of Java programs by abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7186 LNCS, pp. 223-238, (2012); Arcaini, Paolo, A model-driven process for engineering a toolset for a formal method, Software - Practice and Experience, 41, 2, pp. 155-166, (2011); Arcaini, Paolo, Formal design and verification of self-adaptive systems with decentralized control, ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems, 11, 4, (2017); Aßmann, Uwe, A reference architecture and roadmap for models@run.time systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8378 LNCS, pp. 1-18, (2014); Baresi, Luciano, The disappearing boundary between development-time and run-time, pp. 17-21, (2010); Bencomo, Nelly, Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, Software and Systems Modeling, 18, 5, pp. 3049-3082, (2019); Bonfanti, Silvia, Design and validation of a C++ code generator from Abstract State Machines specifications, Journal of Software: Evolution and Process, 32, 2, (2020); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018)","P.

In order to support the engineering of service-oriented software applications, foundational theories, service modeling notations, evaluation techniques fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach are required. This article introduces a framework for modeling and prototyping service-oriented applications. The framework consists of a precise and executable language, SCA-ASM, for model-based design, and of a tool for early and quick design evaluation of service assemblies. The language combines the OASIS/OSOA standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) capability of modeling and assembling heterogeneous service-oriented components in a technology agnostic way, with the rigor of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method able to model notions of service behavior, interactions, orchestration, compensation and context-awareness in an abstract but executable way. The tool is based on existing execution environments for ASM models and SCA applications. An SCA-ASM model of a service-oriented component, possibly not yet implemented in code or available as off-the-shelf, can be (i) simulated and evaluated offline, i.e. in isolation from the other components; or (ii) executed as abstract implementation (or prototype) together with the other components implementations according to the chosen SCA assembly. As proof of concept, a case study taken from EU research projects has been considered to show the functionalities and potentialities of the proposed framework. © 2013, British Computer Society.",Abstract State Machines; Service Component Architecture; Service formal modeling; Service model prototyping,Abstracting; Application programs; Computation theory; Formal methods; Machine oriented languages; Modeling languages; Abstract state machines; Formal model; Service component architecture; Service Model; Service oriented application; Service oriented components; Service oriented computing; Service-oriented softwares; Service oriented architecture (SOA),,,,,,,"Attiogbé, J.

Our approach is illustrated using an Invoice Order System taken from the literature. © 2009 ACM.,Abstract state machines; Behavioral modeling; Model weaving; Model-driven engineering; Platform-independent modeling; UML action language,Abstract state machines; Behavioral modeling; Model weaving; Model-driven engineering; Platform-independent modeling; UML action language; Abstracting; Contour followers; Intermodulation; Intermodulation measurement; Linguistics; Query languages; Weaving; Waveguides,,,,,,,"undefined, (2007); undefined, (2006); Bézivin, Jean, On the unification power of models, Software and Systems Modeling, 4, 2, pp. 171-188, (2005); Börger, Egon, The ASM method for system design and analysis.

This opens the door to the more faithful modelling of many scenarios where digital systems have to interact with the continuously varying physical world. Transitions in the extended framework are thus either moded (catering for discontinuously changing quantities), or pliant (catering for smoothly changing quantities). An operational semantics is provided, first for monolithic systems, and this is then extended to give a semantics for systems consisting of several distinct subsystems. This allows each subsystem to undergo its own subsystem-specific mode and pliant transitions. Refinement is elaborated in the extended context for both monolithic and composed systems.

We point out the limitations of the current WSMO model and propose a faithful extension that is based on Concurrent Transaction Logic (CTR).

A very useful type of model in computing is an abstract state machine which describes transitions over first order structures. The general purpose model-based testing tool SpecExplorer (used within Microsoft, also available externally) uses such a model, written in AsmL or Spec#, to perform a search that checks that all reachable states of the model are safe, and also to check conformance of an arbitrary .NET implementation to the model. Spec Explorer provides a variety of ways to cut clown the state space of the model, for instance by finitizing parameter domains or by providing predicate abstraction. It has already found subtle bugs in production software. First order structures and abstract state machines over them are also a useful way to think about cryptographic protocols, since models formulated in these terms arise by natural abstraction from computational cryptography. In this paper we explain this abstraction process, 'experiments as structures', and argue for its faithfulness. We show how the Dolev-Yao intruder model fits into SpecExplorer. In a word, the actions of the Dolev-Yao intruder are the 'controllable' actions of the testing frame-work, whereas the actions of protocol participants are the 'observable' actions of the model.

In these models, two hierarchies exist: an organizational level hierarchy (describing systems' construction) and a functional level hierarchy (describing systems' functionality). Using a uniform hierarchical modeling language, system models at different hierarchical levels can be aligned in the context of the enterprise model. Using an operational semantics, each system model can be translated into executable code for model simulation and testing. The possibility to simulate and test models leads to the alignment verification for all system models across both hierarchies. In this paper we propose a method and tool for functional alignment verification.

We want to create a tool assisting in the verification of evolving specifications. Our approach is to translate ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, construct the proofs as far as possible automatically, and check the proofs with the proof checker. Further, we want proofs of evolvable specifications also to be evolvable.

In recent years the need for a formal understanding of the structures, the dynamic aspects and the processes of these coalitions has grown. In my ongoing thesis I propose a formal framework based on the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in order to grasp and characterize dynamic coalitions in general and privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions in particular. The ASM formalism allows for a structural description of dynamic coalitions as well as for a formalization of the inherent processes by means of ASM-runs, thereby enabling simulation, testing, and verification possibilities for the design of supporting architectures. This paper shows how the CoreASM-toolset is used to develop an abstract model of dynamic coalitions and extended to integrate trust-based access control mechanisms in order to enforce privacy aspects in highly dynamic coalitions. Finally an ongoing case study is introduced and first insights to the usability of the proposed model are given. © 2013 IEEE.",,Abstract modeling; Abstract state machines; Dynamic coalitions; Formal framework; Networking technology; Privacy aspects; Structural descriptions; Trust-based access control; Computer software; Software engineering,,,,,,,"Proceedings of Formal Aspects of Virtual Organisations, (2008); School of Computing Science Newcastle University Tech Rep Cs TR 963, (2006); Gi Proceedings Informatik 2011 Informatik Schafft Communities, (2011); Proceedings of Favo 2011, (2011); Newcastle University Tech Rep, (2006); Newcastle University Technical Report, (2008); McGinnis, Jarred, A formal framework of virtual organisations as agent societies, Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, EPTCS, 16, pp. 1-14, (2010); Koshutanski, Hristo, Interoperable semantic access control for highly dynamic coalitions, Security and Communication Networks, 3, 6, pp. 565-594, (2010); Chakraborty, Sudip, TrustBAC - Integrating trust relationships into the RBAC model for access control in open systems, 2006, pp. 49-58, (2006); Li, Min, Trust-based access control for privacy protection in collaborative environment, pp. 425-430, (2009)","N.

The refinement definition we give differs from the one we gave in earlier work which preserves partial and total correctness assertions of ASM runs. The reason is that the main goal of the refinement of the Mondex protocol is to preserve a security invariant, while total correctness is not preserved. To preserve invariants, the definition of generalized forward simulation is limited to the use of ""small"" diagrams, which contain of a single protocol step.

Our work is based on [BR95], where an operational Prolog semantics is defined using the formalism of Gurevich Abstract State Machines, and then refined in several steps to the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). We define a general translation of sequential Abstract State Machines to Dynamic Logic, which formalizes correctness of such refinement steps as a deduction problem. A proof technique for verification is presented, which corresponds to the informal use of proof maps. 6 of the 12 given refinement steps were verified.

The question we answer in this paper, is how to add concurrency based on locks to such a refinement tower, without breaking the initial modular structure. We achieve this by just enhancing the relevant components, and adding intermediate atomicity refinements that complement the data refinements that are already there.

One important obstacle to achieving this goal is that executing rules may result in a clash, that aborts the ASM run. This paper contributes three results towards this goal. First, it shows that it is possible to compute a first-order formula for each rule that implies clash-freedom when provable. The derived formula is not a precise characterization, but is provable for many ASMs that are used in practice. Second, we give axioms that describe the transition relation for clash-free ASM rules as formulas of predicate logic that can be used to verify pre/post-condition assertions using automated theorem provers. Third, we show that the relational encoding can be used to justify a calculus for clash-free ASM rules based on symbolic execution. Such a calculus is useful for interactive theorem provers such as our tool KIV. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Abstract state machines; Clashes; Symbolic execution; Synchronous parallelism,Calculations; Computer circuits; Model checking; Abstract state machines; Automated theorem prover; Clashes; Interactive theorem prover; Nondeterministic choice; Parallel composition; Symbolic execution; Synchronous parallelism; Theorem proving,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (RE828/13-1)","This work is partly sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant number RE828/13-1 (“Verifikation von Flash-Dateisystemen”).","Schellhorn, Gerhard, Development of a verified flash file system, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8477 LNCS, pp. 9-24, (2014); Ernst, Gidon, KIV: overview and VerifyThis competition, International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, 17, 6, pp. 677-694, (2015); Schellhorn, Gerhard, A relational encoding for a clash-free subset of ASMs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9675, pp. 237-243, (2016); Stärk, Robert F., A logic for abstract state machines, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 7, 11, pp. 980-1005, (2001); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Java and the Java Virtual Machine Definition Verification Validation, (2001); Börger, Egon, Ambient Abstract State Machines with applications, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 78, 3, pp. 939-959, (2012); Tarski, Alfred, A lattice-theoretical fixpoint theorem and its applications, Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 5, 2, pp. 285-309, (1955); Proof and System Reliability, (2002); Börger, Egon, The WAM — Definition and Compiler Correctness, Studies in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, 11, C, pp. 21-90, (1995)","G.

This article is dedicated to a sketch of a theory of computation centred around the notion of algorithmic systems. I will argue that behavioural theories are key to the understanding, i.e. we require language-independent axiomatic definitions of classes of algorithmic systems that are accompanied by abstract machine models provably capturing the class under consideration. The machine models give further rise to tailored logics through which properties of systems in the considered class can be formalised and verified, and to fine-tuned classifications on the grounds of complexity restrictions. All extensions are conservative in the sense that the classical theory of computation is preserved, universal in the sense that all practical developments are captured uniformly, and practical in the sense that languages associated with the abstract machine models can be used for rigorous high-level systems design and development, and the logics can be exploited for rigorous verification of desirable properties of systems. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Abstract State Machines; Algorithmic system; Behavioural theory; Computation on structures; Software engineering; Theory of computation,Algorithmic languages; Computer software; Parallel processing systems; Abstract machines; Abstract state machines; Algorithmic system; Algorithmics; Behavioral theory; Computation on structure; Machine modelling; Property; Theoretical foundations; Theory of computation; Abstracting,,,,,,,"Blass, Andreas R., Choiceless polynomial time, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 100, 1-3, pp. 141-187, (1999); Computability Complexity Logic Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics, (1989); Börger, Egon, The ASM Refinement Method, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 2-3, pp. 237-257, (2003); Role of Executable Abstract Programs in Software Development and Documentation, (2022); Börger, Egon, Correctness of compiling Occam to transputer code, Computer Journal, 39, 1, pp. 52-92, (1996); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018); Börger, Egon, A mathematical definition of full Prolog, Science of Computer Programming, 24, 3, pp. 249-286, (1995); Börger, Egon, Concurrent abstract state machines, Acta Informatica, 53, 5, pp. 469-492, (2016); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Chandra, Ashok K., Structure and complexity of relational queries, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 25, 1, pp. 99-128, (1982)","K.-D.

We formalise this problem by the notion of the greatest consistent specialisation (GCS) adapting and generalising this 20 year old concept to sequential Abstract State Machines (ASMs) with emphasis on bounded parallelism. In a state satisfying I such that P is repairable the notion of consistent specialisation will require an enlargement of the update set, which defines a partial order with respect to which a GCS is defined. We show that GCSs are compositional in two respects: (1) the GCS of an ASM with a complex rule can be obtained from the GCSs of the involved assignments, and (2) the GCS with respect to a set of invariants can be built using the GCSs for the individual invariants in the set. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Abstract State Machine; Compositionality; Consistency enforcement; Consistent specialisation; Static invariant,Specifications; Abstract state machines; Compositionality; Consistency enforcement; Specialisation; Static invariant; Formal methods,,,,,,,"B Book Assigning Programs to Meanings, (1996); A Behavioural Theory of Recursive Algorithms, (2019); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Cai, Chenghao, B-Repair: Repairing B-models using machine learning, 2018-December, pp. 31-40, (2018); Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics, (1990); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, Systematic refinement of abstract state machines with higher-order logic, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10817 LNCS, pp. 204-218, (2018); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A new thesis concerning synchronised parallel computing – simplified parallel ASM thesis, Theoretical Computer Science, 649, pp. 25-53, (2016); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A complete logic for Database Abstract State Machines, Logic Journal of the IGPL, 25, 5, pp. 700-740, (2017); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A unifying logic for non-deterministic, parallel and concurrent abstract state machines, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, 83, 3-4, pp. 321-349, (2018); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000)","K.-D.

Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this paper the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs to capture inferences on rASMs. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location.

Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this article the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs, by means of which we can formally express properties a reflective algorithm must satisfy. The proof theory associated with the logic then enables static verification of adaptive systems. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Abstract state machine; Linguistic reflection; Logic; Tree algebra,Adaptive systems; Abstract state machines; Proof theory; Static verification; Computer circuits,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT; Bundesministerium für Digitalisierung und Wirtschaftsstandort, BMDW, (FFG-865891)","The research reported in this paper has been partly funded by BMVIT, BMDW, and the Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET Programme FFG-865891 managed by FFG.","Balasubramaniam, Dharini, Support for feedback and change in self-adaptive systems, Proceedings of the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 18-22, (2004); Booker, Lashon B., Classifier systems and genetic algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, 40, 1-3, pp. 235-282, (1989); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Persistent Object Systems, (1994); undefined, (2010); Ehrenfeucht, Andrzej, Evolving reaction systems, Theoretical Computer Science, 682, pp. 79-99, (2017); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A new thesis concerning synchronised parallel computing – simplified parallel ASM thesis, Theoretical Computer Science, 649, pp. 25-53, (2016); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A behavioural theory for reflective sequential algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10742 LNCS, pp. 117-131, (2018); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A complete logic for Database Abstract State Machines, Logic Journal of the IGPL, 25, 5, pp. 700-740, (2017)","K.-D.

This remains valid, if different agents can only interact via messages. It even permits a strict separation between memory managing agents and other agents that can only access the shared memory by sending query and update requests. This paper is dedicated to an investigation of replicated data that is maintained by a memory management subsystem, where the replication neither appears in the requests nor in the corresponding answers. We specify the behaviour of a concurrent system with such memory management using concurrent communicating ASMs (ccASMs), provide several refinements addressing different replication policies and internal messaging between data centres, and analyse their effects on the runs with respect to consistency. We show that on a concrete level even a weak form of consistency is only possible, if view serialisability can be guaranteed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Abstract state machines; Concurrent computing; Concurrent systems; Data centres; Memory management; Replicated data; Serialisability; Shared memory; Information management,,,,,,,"Actors A Model of Concurrent Computation in Distributed Systems, (1986); Semantics of Sequential and Parallel Programs, (1996); Blass, Andreas R., Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 4, 4, pp. 578-651, (2003); Börger, Egon, Concurrent abstract state machines, Acta Informatica, 53, 5, pp. 469-492, (2016); Börger, Egon, Communication in abstract state machines, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 23, 2, pp. 129-145, (2017); Börger, Egon, Serialisable multi-level transaction control: A specification and verification, Science of Computer Programming, 131, pp. 42-58, (2016); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio, A new thesis concerning synchronised parallel computing – simplified parallel ASM thesis, Theoretical Computer Science, 649, pp. 25-53, (2016); Genrich, Helga J., System modelling with high-level Petri nets, Theoretical Computer Science, 13, 1, pp. 109-135, (1981); Gurevich, Yuri G., Sequential Abstract-State Machines Capture Sequential Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 1, 1, pp. 77-111, (2000)","K.-D.

In doing so we enable computations on abstract states that are defined by a certain class of automata, in this case VPAs. In this paper we elaborate on this approach by taking also updates of XML documents into account. In this way the ASM-approach combines vertical refinements, which first make states explicit and then instantiate by a specific EDTD, with horizontal refinements, which replace streaming XML documents by stored ones and then add updates. Furthermore, as the EDTD appears as part of the abstract state, updating it is another natural extension by horizontal refinement. In this way we obtain consistently integrated updates and schema updates for XML documents, which can even be extended to become fault-tolerant by taking at most k errors in the document into consideration.

For this the notion of service mediator has been coined, which captures specifications of composed services with slots that have to be filled by actual services. Such mediators can be specified by expressions in Kleene algebras with tests (KATs) or equivalently by very restricted Abstract State Machines (ASMs). In this paper we address the refinement of such specifications with the intention to capture more meaningful conditions on the service slots and to fine-tune the matching of the slots with actual services. In particular, we investigate refinements that express user preferences thus leading to personalised mediators. For this form of adaptivity a previously developed term rewriting approach on KATs is generalised to refinements on ASMs. © 2012 IEEE.",Abstract state machine; Personalisation; Preference rules; Refinement; Service mediator,Abstract state machines; Personalisation; Preference rules; Refinement; Service mediator; Specifications; Quality of service,,,,,,,"Web Services Concepts Architectures and Applications, (2004); Stollberg, Michael, A Semantic Web mediation architecture, pp. 3-22, (2006); Altenhofen, Michael, An abstract model for process mediation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3785 LNCS, pp. 81-95, (2005); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Encyclopedia of Database Systems, (2009); Ma, Hui, A formal model for the interoperability of service clouds, Service Oriented Computing and Applications, 6, 3, pp. 189-205, (2012); Schewe, Klaus Dieter, A formal model for service mediators, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6413 LNCS, pp. 76-85, (2010); Encyclopedia of Database Systems, (2009); Web Services Description Language Wsdl 1 1, (2001); Web Service Semantics Wsdl S, (2005)","K.-D.

These machines permit unbounded parallelism only on the finite database part of a state. This paper generalises this work by permitting unbounded parallelism on the algorithmic part of the state as well. The ""parallel DB-ASM""-thesis results from combining Gurevich's parallel ASM thesis with the DB-ASM thesis. In doing so, it turns out that the postulates for synchronous parallel database transformations can be significantly simplified compared with the seminal work of Gurevich.

Compatibility of such partial updates to disjoint locations can be assured by applying applicative algebras. However, due to the arbitrary nesting of type constructors, locations of complex-value database are often defined at multiple abstraction levels and thereby non-disjoint. Thus, applicative algebras is not as smooth as its simple definition suggests. In this paper, we investigate this problem in the context of complex-value databases, where partial updates arise naturally in database transformations. We show that a more efficient solution can be obtained when generalising the notion of location and thus permitting dependencies between locations. On these grounds we develop a systematic approach to consistency checking for update sets that involve partial updates. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

In general, they can be characterised by five postulates, which constitute the database analogue of Gurevich's sequential ASM thesis. Among these postulates the background postulate supposedly captures the particularities of data models and schemata. For the characterisation of XML database transformations the natural first step is therefore to define the appropriate tree-based backgrounds, which draw on hereditarily finite trees, tree algebra operations, and extended document type definitions. This defines a computational model for XML database transformation using a variant of Abstract State Machines.

This makes them an ideal formal method for applications in areas, where otherwise only semi-formal methods are used. One such area is the development of data warehouse and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) applications to which this article contributes. Based on an ASM ground model for data warehouses we show which problems have to be solved in the case of distribution. This mainly amounts to making decisions on materialised views. In this article we develop simple refinement rules for this purpose. Then we develop a cost model that combines the costs of query processing with the maintenance costs arising from redundancy in the local data warehouse fragments. This cost model indicates, whether it is advantageous to apply a refinement rule or not. However, as the refinement process is non-deterministic, there is no guarantee that a global cost optimum will be reached.

Various UML diagrams are used for specification of different aspects of the application. Their interpretation, extension, revision and integration becomes awful difficult if developers use the full freedom of UML, apply their own semantics and do not agree an common parts. We propose an approach that limits this freedom to the necessary extend. Developers have the full freedom on parts of the specification that is independent from others and are committed to fulfill contracts on parts of the specification that is also used by other developers. Due to a lack of semantics the integration of various UML diagrams is often left to the intuition of software engineers, which bears the risk of UML-based software development becoming error-prone. In this paper we propose the use of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as a means to support the integration of UML diagrams by means of invertible translations of UML clusters, i.e. sets of UML diagrams together with constraints defined on them, into easily understandable ASM specifications. In doing so, the rigorous semantics of ASMs induces an unambiguous semantics for the UML clusters. These translations themselves can be formalised by ASM specifications thereby automating the translation process. Furthermore, the evolution of UML clusters is guarded by contracts, which can again by specified by ASMs. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,Abstract state machines; Error prones; Software development; Software engineers; Translation process; UML diagrams; Computer software; Graphic methods; Semantics; Standardization; Specifications,,,,,,,"Börger, Egon, An ASM semantics for UML activity diagrams, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1816, pp. 293-308, (2000); Börger, Egon, Modeling the dynamics of UML State Machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1912 LNCS, pp. 223-241, (2000); Barnett, Mike, Validating use-cases with the AsmL test tool, Proceedings - International Conference on Quality Software, 2003-January, pp. 238-246, (2003); Boehm, Barry W., Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-25, 12, pp. 1226-1241, (1976); Börger, Egon, The ASM Refinement Method, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 2-3, pp. 237-257, (2003); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Bidoit, Michel, Architectural specifications in CASL, Formal Aspects of Computing, 13, 3-5, pp. 252-273, (2002); Chauvel, Franck, Code generation from UML models with semantic variation points, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3713 LNCS, pp. 54-68, (2005); Thalheim, Bernhard, SiteLang: Conceptual modeling of internet sites, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2224, pp. 179-192, (2001); undefined, (2010)",,"Abrial, J.-R.; Glasser, U.",,,,,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

Its polymorphic entities (types, operators, axioms) can easily be equipped with a 'naive' semantics defined in terms of collections of instances. However, this semantics has the unpleasant property that while model reduction preserves satisfaction of sentences, model expansion generally does not. In other words, unless further measures are taken, type class polymorphism fails to constitute a proper institution, being only a so-called rps preinstitution; this is unfortunate, as it means that one cannot use institution-independent or heterogeneous structuring languages, proof calculi, and tools with it. Here, we suggest to remedy this problem by modifying the notion of model to include information also about its potential future extensions. Our construction works at a high level of generality in the sense that it provides, for any preinstitution, an institution in which the original preinstitution can be represented. The semantics of polymorphism used in the specification language HASCASL makes use of this result. In fact, HASCASL'S polymorphism is a special case of a general notion of polymorphism in institutions introduced here, and our construction leads to the right notion of semantic consequence when applied to this generic polymorphism. The appropriateness of the construction for other frame-works that share the same problem depends on methodological questions to be decided case by case. In particular, it turns out that our method is apparently unsuitable for observational logics, while it works well with abstract state machine formalisms such as state-based CASL. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,Computer programming languages; Information science; Mathematical operators; Semantics; Axioms; Higher-order logic; Institutional framework; Polymorphism; Formal logic,,,,,,,"Abstract and Concrete Categories, (1990); Jon Barwise, K., Axioms for abstract model theory, Annals of Mathematical Logic, 7, 2-3, pp. 221-265, (1974); 15th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques, (2001); Baumeister, Hubert, State-based extension of casl, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1945, pp. 3-24, (2000); Bidoit, Michel, On the integration of observability and reachability concepts, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2303, pp. 21-36, (2002); Lncs, (2004); Borzyszkowski, Tomasz, Higher-order logic and theorem proving for structured specifications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1827, pp. 401-418, (2000); Bossi, Annalisa, Refinement operators and information flow security, pp. 44-53, (2003); Reggio, Gianna, Very abstract specifications: A formalism independent approacht, Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, 8, 1, pp. 17-66, (1998); Coquand, Thierry, ANALYSIS OF GIRARD'S PARADOX., Proceedings - Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 227-236, (1986)",,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,"17th International Workshop, WADT 2004",,,,03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9783032004949; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141,,,English,Lect.

The right choice of model and modeling language is important for both designers and users of verification tools. This chapter aims to provide a guide to system modeling in four stages. First, it provides an overview of the main issues one must consider in modeling systems for verification. These issues involve both the selection or design of a modeling language and the steps of model creation. Next, it introduces a simple modeling language, SML, for illustrating the issues involved in selecting or designing a modeling language. SML uses an abstract state machine formalism that captures key features of widely-used languages based on transition system representations. We introduce the simple modeling language to simplify the connection between languages used by practitioners (such as Verilog, Simulink, or C) and various underlying formalisms (e.g., automata or Kripke structures) used in model checking. Third, the chapter demonstrates key steps in model creation using SML with illustrative examples. Finally, the presented modeling language SML is mapped to standard formalisms such as Kripke structures. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

In some sense, objects with integer dimension are partial cases of the more general realm of entities having a ragged shape and fractional dimension. Fractals of a broad class are described by deterministic iterated function systems (IFSs). Simultaneously, the iterated function systems give a base for 'automata networks' capable to realize their latent dynamics. When such a dynamics become alive (with the help of an appropriate automata network), it finishes in a steady state which is (in the general case) a fractal set. In this report, an algorithm is described for building an automata network for a given iterated function system. It is worth noting that the 'automata networks' can be considered generalizations of cellular automata, the main difference is that our automata networks have non-regular structure of the system of the cell neighborhoods. An evolving algebra approach for description of the automata network dynamical systems is also mentioned. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of IMACS.",Automata networks; Evolving algebras; Fractal geometry; Iterated function systems,Algebra; Algorithms; Fractals; Iterative methods; Automata networks; Iterated function systems (IFS); Automata theory,,,,,,,"Fractal Geometry of Nature, (1982); Fractals Everywhere, (1993); Stark, Jaroslav, Iterated Function Systems as neural networks, Neural Networks, 4, 5, pp. 679-690, (1991); Fractals and Chaos, (1991); Severyanov, Vasily M., Parallel computation of fractal sets with the help of neural networks and cellular automata, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1277, pp. 109-114, (1997); Parallel Distributed Processing, (1986); Humpert, B., A comparative study of neural networks architectures, Computer Physics Communications, 58, 3, pp. 223-256, (1990); New Computing Techniques in Physics Research IV Proceedings of the IV International Workshop on Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence for High Energy and Nuclear Physics, (1995); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Bull Eatcs, (1991)","V.M.

A challenging problem in requirements modeling for real-time embedded software is to devise an easy-to-use formal requirements modeling language and a corresponding requirements modeling approach. Timed Abstract State Machine, abbreviated as TASM, is an easy-to-use formal requirements modeling language, but it has its limitations. We have extended TASM. In this paper, we propose an extended TASM-based requirements modeling approach for real-time embedded software to identify the parallel and hierarchical components, and describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

The UML metamodel consists of informal description, class diagrams which are used to give the abstract syntax, and the well-formedness rules given in OCL. Furthermore, class diagrams have played an important role in software development because they provide basic information about a software system. In this paper, we propose a new method to support class diagrams based on Abstract State Machines. As an application of this method we will use a class diagram to represent OCL structure and therefore an OCL translator is generated. Based on the support of class diagrams and OCL, any user-defined UML model (M1-level), as an instantiation of the UML metamodel, can be compared against the UML metamodel. On the other hand, an object model (M0-level) can be checked based on the user-defined UML model (M1-level). Therefore, more errors can be reported to software developers during the early phase of software development.",Abstract state machines; Model checking,Abstract state machines; Abstract syntax; Class diagrams; Instantiation checking; Model architecture; Software developer; Software systems; Well-formedness rules; Information science; Model checking; Software design; Unified Modeling Language; Encoding (symbols),,,,,,,"Dresden OCL Toolkit; Anlauff, Matthias, Xasm- an Extensible, component-based Abstract State Machines language, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1912 LNCS, pp. 69-90, (2000); Börger, Egon, An ASM semantics for UML activity diagrams, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1816, pp. 293-308, (2000); Börger, Egon, Modeling the dynamics of UML State Machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1912 LNCS, pp. 223-241, (2000); Cavarra, Alessandra, Integrating UML static and dynamic views and formalizing the interaction mechanism of UML state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2589, pp. 229-243, (2003); Design and Implementation of A Modular OCL Compiler, (2000); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Technical Report, (2001); Ober, Ileana, An ASM semantics of UML derived from the meta-model and incorporating actions, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2589, pp. 356-371, (2003); Omg Unified Modeling Language Specification Version 1 5, (2003)",,,,,"IASTED International Conference on Software Engineering: part of the 23rd IASTED International Multi-Conference on Applied Informatics, SE 2005",,,,,9780889864641; 0889864640,,,English,"Proc.

The distributed ASMs that underpin the SDL semantics are defined in terms of agents that execute ASM programs concurrently, acting on partial views of a global state. The discrete identities of successive global states are ensured by allowing input from the external world only between steps, and by having all agents refer to an external global time. But distributed systems comprising independent agents do not have a natural global time. Nor do they have natural global states. This paper takes well-known concepts from relativity and applies them to ASMs. The spacetime in which an ASM exists and moves is defined, and some properties that must be preserved by transformations of the frame of reference of an ASM are identified.

As yet, however, models of distributed computation are based on the idea that data is conceptually centralized. That is, they assume that data, even if it is distributed, is consistent. This assumption is not valid for many of the database systems in use today, where consistency is compromised to ensure availability and partition tolerance. Starting with an informal definition of eventual consistency, this paper explores several measures of inconsistency that quantify how far from consistency a system is. These measures capture key aspects of eventual consistency in terms of distributed abstract state machines. The definitions move from the traditional binary definition of consistency to more quantitative definitions, where the classical consistency is given by the highest possible level of consistency. Expressing eventual consistency in terms of abstract state machines allows models to be developed that capture distributed computation and highly available distributed data within a single framework. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Abstract state machine; Distributed state; Eventual consistency; Formality,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Abstract state machines; Distributed abstract state machine; Distributed computations; Distributed state; Eventual consistency; Formality; Level of consistencies; Quantitative definition; Systems analysis,,,,,,,"Apache Software Foundation Apache Cassandra 4 0 Web Page and Documentation, (2019); Semantics of Sequential and Parallel Programs, (1996); Blass, Andreas R., Ordinary interactive small-step algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 7, 2, pp. 363-419, (2006); Blass, Andreas R., Interactive small-step algorithms I: Axiomatization, Logical Methods in Computer Science, 3, 4, (2007); Corr Abs 0811, (2008); Blass, Andreas R., Persistent queries in the behavioral theory of algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 12, 2, (2011); Lncs, (2008); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Börger, Egon, Modeling companion for software practitioners, pp. 1-349, (2018); Börger, Egon, Concurrent abstract state machines, Acta Informatica, 53, 5, pp. 469-492, (2016)","E.

Effective in these cases are gaming approaches that increase patient motivation, which in the field of e-Health form the direction of ""Serious Games"". The essential requirements in the development of Serious Games are the continuity of training, which should be carried out not only in a specialized center, but al-so by the patient himself at home, as well as the accuracy of the movements performed by the patient; otherwise, the outcome of the rehabilitation will be doubtful or even negative. As the basis for satisfying the rigorous requirements for the correctness of the movements performed the automatic simulation of the game process is chosen. Serious Games differ from regular games in a significantly smaller number of possible states, which makes them convenient for applying this approach. At the same time, in contrast to the previously considered applications of au-tomaton models in medical systems, such as, for example, systems for sup-porting hemodialysis, in the case of a game, the parameters of each state can vary over a fairly wide range. In the article, this problem is considered in the example of rehabilitation of pinch movements of hands by performing physical exercises in a specialized video game form using motion capture of fingers on a smartphone. The Ab-stract State Machine method is used to build the automaton model applicable to the Serious Game for pinch movement, which provides opportunities and motivation of the patient to do independent exercises. To build the resulting model, the method of successive refinements is used, on each of which veri-fication is performed, which provides the necessary control over the accuracy of patient movements. © Proceedings of the 12th IADIS International Conference e-Health 2020, EH 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

We extend ASMs to support the specification of timing requirements, which we call timed constructs. We also describe the composition of timed constructs with sequential and parallel computation. A key contribution of this paper is the extension of the force-directed scheduling algorithm to support both parallel and timed constructs.

We select the FDS algorithm because it maximizes the amount of resource sharing, and it naturally supports constructs for parallelism. However, timed constructs are not supported. As a result, we propose timed FDS (TFDS) that optimizes over parallel, timed and untimed constructs. In doing so, we make the following four contributions: 1) we extend the definition of control data flow graphs (CDFGs) to define timed CDFGs (TCDFGs), 2) we define a scheduling algorithm for timed constructs called TIME, 3) we extend the definition of mobility used in FDS, and 4) we present optimizations for a composition of parallel, timed and untimed constructs to better aid FDS. We implement our extensions in a high-level synthesis framework based on the abstract state machine formalism, and we generate synthesizable VHDL.

We perform scheduling and allocation on this IR, and generate synthesizable VHDL. We have the following advantages when using ASMs as an IR: 1) it allows the specification of both sequential and parallel computation, 2) it supports an extension of a clean timing model based on an interpretation of the sequential semantics, and 3) it has well-defined formal semantics, which allows the integration of formal methods into the methodology. While we specify our designs using ASMs, we do not mandate this. Instead, one can create translators that convert the algorithmic specifications from C-like languages into their equivalent ASM specifications. This makes the hardware synthesis transparent to the designer. We experiment our methodology with examples of a FIR, microprocessor, and an edge detecteor.

This paper seeks to explore the boundaries of the ideas of computation and provide a framework for enabling a constructive discussion of computational ideas. First, a review of computing is given, ranging from Turing Machines to interactive computing. Then, a variety of natural physical systems are considered for their computational qualities. From this exploration, a framework is presented under which all dynamical systems can be considered as instances of the class of abstract computational platforms. An abstract computational platform is defined by both its intrinsic dynamics and how it allows computation that is meaningful to an external agent through the configuration of constraints upon those dynamics. It is asserted that a platform's computational expressiveness is directly related to the freedom with which constraints can be placed. Finally, the requirements for a formal constraint description language are considered and it is proposed that Abstract State Machines may provide a reasonable basis for such a language.",,,,,,,,,"Bishop, John Mark, Stochastic searching networks, IEE Conference Publication, 313, pp. 329-331, (1989); ACM Transactions on Computational Logic Tocl, (2006); American Journal of Mathematics, (1936); Copeland, B.

We introduce a class of restricted ASM-programs, which are called nullary programs, and provide an algorithm that decides whether a given nullary program satisfies a given correctness property (expressible in a CTL*-like temporal logic) on all inputs. Our decision algorithm runs in Pspace and we show that this is optimal.

However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g.,in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed.

The state of an Abstract State Machine has two components: a behavioural state and a data state. The behavioural states are shown on a state diagram, whose transitions are labelled with an “event” and a B operation. The firing of a transition is synonymous with the occurrence of its associated event. We use a synchronous model of communication based on shared events which simultaneously change the state of each participating machine. The B operation associated with a transition generally has the form G ⟹ S, where a necessary condition for the transition to fire is that G is true, and where S describes any resulting changes in the data state of the Abstract Machine.

The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Educational robots; Feature models; Generative learning objects (GLOs); GLO design tool; Model transformation,C (programming language); Education computing; Educational robots; Graphic methods; Product design; Robot programming; Robots; Software design; Specifications; Teaching; Abstract state machines; Computer Science Education; Design tool; Feature based approaches; Feature models; Learning objects; Model transformation; Variability modelling; Machine design,,,,,,,"Hadjerrouit, Said, Teaching and learning school informatics: A concept-based pedagogical approach, Informatics in Education, 8, 2, pp. 227-250, (2009); Guide to Teaching Computer Science an Activity Based Approach, (2011); Online Education Using Learning Objects, (2004); Rossano, Veronica, A taxonomy for definitions and applications of LOs: A meta-analysis of ICALT papers, Educational Technology and Society, 8, 4, pp. 148-160, (2005); Štuikys, Vytautas, Teaching of computer science topics using meta-programming-based glos and lego robots, Informatics in Education, 12, 1, pp. 125-142, (2013); Wg12 Learning Object Metadata; Ascilite, (2002); Learning Object Design and Sequencing Theory, (2000); Polsani, Pithamber Rao, Use and abuse of reusable learning objects, Journal of Digital Information, 3, 4, (2003); Online Education Using Learning Objects, (2004)","V.

To enable automatic analysis of these embedded systems, many analysis tools have been developed based on hybrid automata model. These tools are constructed by their own domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) but they are different in various aspects. To enable meaningful semantic interpretation of DSMLs, we propose an infrastructure for semantic anchoring that facilitates the transformational specification of DSML semantics. In the semantic anchoring infrastructure, the semantics of a DSML can be anchored to a well-defined semantic unit, which captures the operational semantics of hybrid automaton, via model transformation. The Abstract State Machine (ASM) is used as the underlying formal framework for the semantic unit. The semantics of a DSML is defined by specifying the transformation between the abstract syntax metamodel of the DSML and that of the semantic unit. The infrastructure can also enable model exchange among DSMLs while referring to the common semantic unit. Hence, hybrid automata based DSMLs can be integrated to form a meaningful tool chain by deploying this proposed infrastructure. In this paper, we demonstrate how effective the tool-chain infrastructure is by considering a practical case study involving the hybrid automata DSMLs, HyVisual and ReachLab. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,Automata theory; Computational methods; Computer programming languages; Mathematical models; Semantics; Abstract state machine (ASM); Abstract syntax metamodel; Domain specific modeling languages (DSML); Semantic anchoring; Embedded systems,,,,,,,"Karsai, Gábor, Model-integrated development of embedded software, Proceedings of the IEEE, 91, 1, pp. 145-164, (2003); Karsai, Gábor, On the use of graph transformation in the formal specification of model interpreters, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 9, 11, pp. 1296-1321, (2003); Chen, Kai, Toward a semantic anchoring infrastructure for domain-specific modeling languages, pp. 35-43, (2005); Chen, Kai, Semantic anchoring with model transformations, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3748 LNCS, pp. 115-129, (2005); Chen, Kai, A semantic unit for timed automata based modeling languages, Proceedings of the IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, RTAS, 2006, pp. 347-357, (2006); Dubey, Abhishek, Computation platform for automatic analysis of embedded software systems using model based approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3707 LNCS, pp. 114-128, (2005); Hyvisual A Hybrid System Visual Modeler, (2003); Asml, (2006); Lee, Edward A., A framework for comparing models of computation, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 17, 12, pp. 1217-1229, (1998); Alur, Rajeev, A theory of timed automata, Theoretical Computer Science, 126, 2, pp. 183-235, (1994)","T.J.

At the software architecture level, designers combine subsystems into complete systems using different techniques, e. g. “Architecture Description Languages"" (ADLs). There exists a number of ADLs, each of which is specialized for one or more architectural styles. They are designed by different research groups with different goals in mind corresponding to their mental model on how software architecture can be expressed in the most eficient and elegant way. As a result, ADLs are not compatible with each other, so that it is dificult to present a homogeneous view of the software architecture of a system assembled from different components.

The central idea is that - once relevant information pieces of digital documents are modeled - desired migration results can be specified by means of preservation constraints. From these constraint specifications we are able to derive migration algorithms that provably respect a set of document properties before (pre-conditions) and after migration (post-conditions). Underlying is the concept of Abstract State Machines (ASM) modeling archival states. Migrations are modeled as sequences of basic operations that change the archive's state while respecting user-defined constraints. Among others, our target scenarios comprise legal and medical documents where considerable property changes cannot be tolerated and where constraint pre-servation must hold over a long period of time.

They have to provide the means to specify a complex and large amount of knowledge and they have to provide the means to specify the dynamic reasoning behavior of a knowledge-based system. This paper focuses on the second aspect. For this purpose, we survey existing approaches for specifying dynamic behavior in related areas of research. In fact, we have taken approaches for the specification of information systems (Language for Conceptual Modeling and TROLL), approaches for the specification of database updates and logic programming (Transaction Logic and Dynamic Database Logic) and the generic specification framework of Abstract State Machines.",Dynamics; Inference control; Knowledge-based systems; Specification languages; Update logics,Database systems; Formal languages; Inference engines; Information science; Logic programming; Software engineering; Specification languages; Knowledge based systems,,,,,,,"Brazier, Frances M.T., Desire: Modelling multi-agent systems in a compositional formal framework, International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems, 6, 1, pp. 67-94, (1997); Brazier, Frances M.T., Temporal semantics of compositional task models and problem solving methods, Data and Knowledge Engineering, 29, 1, pp. 17-42, (1999); Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language Karl, (1995); Fensel, Dieter, The Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language, KARL, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 10, 4, pp. 527-550, (1998); Formal Specification of Complex Reasoning Systems, (1993); Spee, Jan Willem, The semantics of KBSSF, a language for KBS design, Knowledge Acquisition, 6, 4, pp. 369-393, (1994); Van Harmelen, Frank A.H., (ML)2: A formal language for KADS models of expertise, Knowledge Acquisition, 4, 1, pp. 127-161, (1992); Proc 12th European Conf Artificial Intelligence Ecai 96, (1996); Pierret-Golbreich, Christine, TFL: An algebraic language to specify the dynamic behaviour of knowledge-based systems, Knowledge Engineering Review, 11, 3, pp. 253-280, (1996); Formal Specification of Complex Reasoning Systems, (1993)","P.

In order to improve the performance of the generated machine instructions, JIT compilers heavily rely on dynamic analysis of the code. Existing work treats the components of a JIT compiler as a monolithic whole, tied to particular execution semantics. We propose a formal framework that facilitates the design and implementation of a tracing JIT compiler and its accompanying dynamic analyses by decoupling the tracing, optimization, and interpretation processes. This results in a framework that is more configurable and extensible than existing formal tracing models. We formalize the tracer and interpreter as two abstract state machines that communicate through a minimal, well-defined interface. Developing a tracing JIT compiler becomes possible for arbitrary interpreters that implement this interface. The abstract machines also provide the necessary hooks to plug in custom analyses and optimizations. © 2015 ACM.",Dynamic analysis; Operational semantics; Tracing JIT compilation,Dynamic analysis; Interface states; Just in time production; Semantics; Abstract machines; Abstract state machines; Design and implementations; Execution semantics; Formal foundation; Jit compilations; Machine instructions; Operational semantics; Program compilers,,,,,,,"Bolz-Tereick, Carl Friedrich, Tracing the meta-level: PyPy's tracing JIT compiler, pp. 18-25, (2009); Dissegna, Stefano, Tracing compilation by abstract interpretation, Conference Record of the Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, pp. 47-59, (2014); Felleisen, Matthias, A calculus for assignments in higher-order languages, Conference Record of the Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, Part F130236, pp. 314-325, (1987); Fulton, Mike, Compilation techniques for real-time java programs, pp. 221-231, (2007); Guo, Shuyu, The essence of compiling with traces, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, 46, 1, pp. 563-574, (2011); Suganuma, Toshio, A dynamic optimization framework for a Java just-in-time compiler, Proceedings of the Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA, 36, pp. 180-194, (2001)",,"Xu, H.; Binder, W.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org",ACM SIGPLAN,"13th International Workshop on Dynamic Analysis, WODA 2015",26/10/2015,Pittsburgh,117427,,9.78145E+12,,,English,WODA - Proc.

Here model programs are described using the ASM language AsmL. We assume a background containing linear arithmetic, sets, and tuples.

For modeling reactive systems, one uses input-output model programs, where the action vocabulary is divided between two conceptual players: the input player and the output player. The players share the action vocabulary and make moves that are labeled by actions according to their respective model programs. Conformance between the two model programs means that the output (input) player only makes output (input) moves that are allowed by the input (output) players model program. In a bounded game, the total number of moves is fixed. Here model programs use a background theory T containing linear arithmetic, sets, and tuples. We formulate the bounded game conformance checking problem, or BGC, as a theorem proving problem modulo T and analyze its complexity. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,Abstract state machines; Background theory; Behavioral specification; Bounded games; Conformance checking; Input output model; Linear arithmetic; Model programs; Reactive system; Computer science; Game theory; Theorem proving; Input output programs,,,,,,,"Alur, Rajeev, Really temporal logic, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, pp. 164-169, (1989); Alur, Rajeev, Alternating refinement relations, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1466, pp. 164-178, (1998); undefined, (2009); Biere, Armin, Symbolic model checking without BDDs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1579, pp. 193-207, (1999); Logics of Specification Languages, (2007); Lpar, (2008); Technical Report MSR TR 2009 2014 Microsoft Research, (2009); Blass, Andreas R., Play to test, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3997 LNCS, pp. 32-46, (2006); Bryant, Randal E., Exploiting positive equality in a logic of equality with uninterpreted functions, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1633, pp. 470-482, (1999); Burch, Jerry R., Automatic verification of pipelined microprocessor control, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 818 LNCS, pp. 68-80, (1994)","M.

The system allows SMEs to store its confidential data on-premise, enhancing the client's control over the data.

We decompose the client to cloud interaction into three distinct scenarios and introduce a set of ASM rules for each of them. We first consider a direct client to cloud interaction where the identity information stored on the client side is mapped to the identity created on the cloud provider's IdM system. To enhance privacy we then introduce the concept of real, obfuscated and partially obfuscated identities. Finally we take advantage of the increase in standardization in IdM systems defining the rules necessary to support authentication protocols such as OpenID. Our solution makes no supposition regarding the technologies used by the client and the cloud provider. Through abstract functions we allow for a distinct separation between the IdM system of the client and that of the cloud or service provider. Since a user is only required to authenticate once to our system, our solution represents a client centric single sign-on mechanism for the use of cloud services. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",abstract state machine; client centric; cloud computing; identity management,Abstract state machines; Authentication protocols; client centric; Cloud providers; Cloud services; Identity information; Identity management; Service provider; Single sign on; Data mining; Cloud computing,,,,,,,"New Threats in Cloud Computing with Focus on Identity and Access Management, (2010); New Threats in Cloud Computing with Focus on Cloud Misuse and Cloud Vulnerabilities from the Client Side, (2010); Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing, (2009); New Threats in Cloud Computing Ensuring Proper Connection and Database Forensics from the Client Side, (2010); Corr, (2011); Dhamija, Rachna, The seven flaws of identity management: Usability and security challenges, IEEE Security and Privacy, 6, 2, pp. 24-29, (2008); Ahn, Gailjoon Joon, Privacy-enhanced user-centric identity management, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, (2009); Schechter, Stuart E., The emperor's new security indicators an evaluation of website authentication and the effect of role playing on usability studies, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 51-65, (2007); Zhang, Yang, Universal identity management model based on anonymous credentials, pp. 305-312, (2010); Alrodhan, Waleed A., Addressing privacy issues in CardSpace, pp. 285-291, (2007)","M.B.

They allow for comprehensive testing of an implementation in terms of its intended behaviour. In practice however they are rarely generated and maintained during software development, hence their benefits can rarely be exploited. We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives.

There are still many functional or semantic problems for traditional modeling language and modeling method, when they are used into the security modeling. Therefore, based on the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL), this paper proposes the AADL error model and extracted the timing fault tree. After comprehensive analysis by using the common factor failure analysis and the hardware and software failure analysis, we can obtain the generation mechanism of danger. By establishing the AADL multi-view security model of the software system, and converting it into the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) and the Markov model, this paper forms a method of the security verification and evaluation based on extended AADL model. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing security analysis for an instance. © 2018 IEEE.",AADL; Error model; Markov model; Security verification and evaluation; TASM,Computer hardware; Failure (mechanical); Fault tree analysis; Hybrid systems; Markov processes; Modeling languages; Semantics; Verification; Architecture analysis and design language (AADL); Comprehensive analysis; Generation mechanism; Hardware and software; Security verification; System complexity; Timed abstract state machines (TASM); Traditional models; Computer software selection and evaluation,,,,,National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This paper is completed in support of Basic Scientific Research Program of National Defense, so at first, we would like to express our thanks for the strong support of the National Defense Science and Technology Bureau.

Based on the profile mechanism of unified modeling language (UML) 2.2, a kind of DSML is presented to model simulation testing systems of avionic software (STSAS). To define the syntax, semantics and notions of the DSML, the domain model of the STSAS from which we generalize the domain concepts and relationships among these concepts is given, and then, the domain model is mapped into a UML meta-model, named UML-STSAS profile. Assuming a flight control system (FCS) as system under test (SUT), we design the relevant STSAS.

As an example, finite state machines (FSMs) and their graphical counterpart - state transition diagrams - are heavily used e.g. for the specification of various kinds of protocols such as network protocols (e.g. TCP/IP), protocols for infrared data transmission, etc. Many embedded systems, such as telephone switching systems and television control, are directly based on state machines. Introducing generic components for state machines can raise the source code abstraction level from `hard-coded' control flow decisions such as `switch/case' and `if' to a more flexible implementation model of control flow. This paper shows that it is possible to use statecharts and their advanced mechanisms from specification to implementation of reactive systems. By explicitly modeling states and state transitions the source code is described at a higher abstraction level and thereby top-down program comprehension is facilitated.

In order to cope with the higher complexity of software systems, we additionally need a means for reducing the system's state space. This can be done be applying abstraction to large or infinite data parts of the model. In our work, we introduce an interface from the high-level modelling language ASM to Multiway Decision Graphs (MDGs). Similar to OBDDs, MDGs are a data structure suitable for symbolic representation of transition systems, and their model checking. Since MDGs support the representation of abstract sorts and functions they can treat abstract models. We present a transformation algorithm from ASM to MDGs that automatically generates abstract models once the user has marked the data to be abstracted. We adapt the MDG model checking algorithms for the treatment of ASM models. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",,Algorithms; Computer hardware; Computer programming languages; Data structures; Functions; Interfaces (computer); Mathematical transformations; Semantics; Abstract state machines (ASM); Model checking; Multiway Decision Graphs (MDG); State exploration; Computer aided software engineering,,,,,,,"Burch, Jerry R., Automatic verification of pipelined microprocessor control, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 818 LNCS, pp. 68-80, (1994); Brics Notes Series, (1995); Technical Report, (2000); Formal Hardware Verification Methods and Systems in Comparison, (1997); Cyrluk, David A., Ground temporal logic: A logic for hardware verification, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 818 LNCS, pp. 247-259, (1994); del Castillo, Giuseppe, Model checking support for the ASM high-level language, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1785 LNCS, pp. 331-346, (2000); Corella, Francisco, Multiway Decision Graphs for Automated Hardware Verification, Formal Methods in System Design, 10, 1, pp. 7-46, (1997); Graf, Susanne, Construction of abstract state graphs with PVS, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1254, pp. 72-83, (1997); Specification and Validation Methods, (1995); Abstract State Machines",,"Stoller, S.D.; Visser, W.",,,Workshop on Software Model Checking (in Connection with CAV '01),,,,15710661,,,,English,Electron.

ISAs are typically implemented in hardware as microprocessors, but also in software running on a host processor, i.e. virtual machines (VMs). Despite there being many ISAs in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of robust ISAs by the formal construction of all normal and exception conditions for each instruction. This is a task to which the Event-B (Metayer et al. in Rodin deliverable 3.2 Event-B language, http://rodin.cs.ncl.ac.uk, 2005; Schneider in The B-method an introduction, Palgrave, Basingstoke, 2001) formal notation is well suited. This paper describes a project to use the Rodin tool-set (Abrial in Formal methods and software engineering, Springer, Berlin, 2006) to perform such a process, ultimately producing two variants of the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) ISA (Wright in Abstract state machines, B and Z, Springer, Berlin, 2007; Wright in MIDAS machine specification, Bristol University, http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications, 2009) as VMs. The abstract model is incrementally refined to variant models capable of automatic translation to C source code, which this is compiled to create useable VMs. These are capable of running binary executables compiled from high-level languages such as C (Kernighan and Ritchie in The C programming language, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1988), and compilers targeted to each variant allow demonstration programs to be executed on them.

We take the abstract state machine (ASM) as operation semantics for formalising communication model when using IaaS platform services, which can show the changes of dynamic performance about the platform status. Meanwhile, we simplify the model without sacrificing the service correctness from user's perspective. Finally, we give the security attributes of cloud services and find some threats prone to service failure by using model checking tools UPPAAL to analyse the performance of current IaaS platform. This paper also provides a theory fundamental for the security enforcement of IaaS service and contributes to the prevailing of cloud computing. © © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Abstract state machine; ASM; Cloud services modelling; IaaS; Infrastructure-as-a-service; Risk analysis; UPPAAL,Behavioral research; Computation theory; Distributed database systems; Model checking; Network security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Semantics; Web services; Abstract state machines; Cloud services; Communication modeling; IaaS; Model checking tools; Security enforcement; Security risk analysis; UPPAAL; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS),,,,,,,"Benzina, Hedi, Towards designing secure virtualized systems, pp. 250-255, (2012); Börger, Egon, Ten years of Gurevich's abstract state machines, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 3, 4, pp. 230-232, (1997); Börger, Egon, High level system design and analysis using abstract state machines, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1641, pp. 1-43, (1999); Fu, Xiang, Analysis of interacting BPEL Web services, pp. 621-630, (2004); Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, (1993); Zhu, Jun, A Web services interaction behavior-environment model based on generalized stochastic Petri nets, Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan/Computer Research and Development, 49, 11, pp. 2450-2463, (2012); Khan, Imran, Design and deployment of a trusted Eucalyptus cloud, pp. 380-387, (2011); Zaerens, Klaus, Gaining the profits of cloud computing in a public authority environment, International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering, 7, 4, pp. 269-279, (2012); Larsen, Kim Guldstrand, Uppaal in a nutshell, International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, 1, 1-2, pp. 134-152, (1997); Li, Lixing, Modeling and verifying services of internet of things based on timed automata, Jisuanji Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Computers, 34, 8, pp. 1365-1377, (2011)","Z.

The invariants of secrecy properties defined in the systems are maintained by the operations of intruder as well as regular participants of a protocol (see \[1\] for detailed discussion). It is well known that an authentication protocol usually has two functionalities: one is to identify the \[D of participants, while the other is to distribute session keys to be used thereafter.

The behaviors of the described expressions may be captured (with their models) as causing sequences for state transitions, where composition and alternation for state transitions are mechanized in algebraic structure. Monitoring facilities to the language system may be described with state concepts, as well. With respect to intuitionistic logic and logical program containing negatives, Heyting algebra expressions are taken rather than already established nonmonotonic reasoning programs with negations, where 3-valued domain may be of use for the undefined to be allowable such that positives and negatives may be consistently evaluated, instead of rigid 2-valued settlements. We may have a standard form of Heyting algebra expressions in accordance to logical and AI programming, where the expressions are constrained with states. The states may be regarded as environmental conditions or objects as in object-oriented programming. As regards 3-valued models of given expressions, monotonic mapping cannot be in general associated with, but some ways are presented to approximate fixed points of a mapping for the given expression. Then the formal description of programs may be given with reference to state transitions, which is thought of as proposing a language system structure. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Logical models are here presented as theories for implementation design on iDevice, with respect to the algebraic structure caused by state transitions. As a simpler design of complex AI, the environmental constraint is captured as a state, where the function applications are available at each state with the transition to the next states. For communication to the state, and function applications at the state, multi-modal logic model may be of use, where the formula or the condition monitors the state. Then interaction availability is significant, expressed in some algebra on the basis of the meaning definitions for formulas (conditions). By the state transition system, URL searching operations are now formally considered as in algebraic structure. The application of predicates to the states is regarded as applications of functions (transforming conditions) such that its algebraic structure may be given. © © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",Interactive monitoring; Modal logic and algebra; State constraint agent,Algebra; Formal logic; Information systems; Information use; Semantics; Structural design; Abstract state machines; Algebraic structures; Environmental constraints; Implementation design; Modal logic; Multi-modal logic; State constraints; State transition systems; Computer circuits,,,,,,,"Bertolissi, Clara, Expressing combinatory reduction systems derivations in the rewriting calculus, Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation, 19, 4, pp. 345-376, (2006); Cardelli, Luca, Mobile ambients, Theoretical Computer Science, 240, 1, pp. 177-213, (2000); Handbook of Weighted Automata, (2009); Logical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, (1987); Giordano, L., Ramification and causality in a modal action logic, Journal of Logic and Computation, 10, 5, pp. 625-662, (2000); Hanks, Steve, Nonmonotonic logic and temporal projection, Artificial Intelligence, 33, 3, pp. 379-412, (1987); Hennessy, Matthew C.B., Algebraic Laws for Nondeterminism and Concurrency, Journal of the ACM, 32, 1, pp. 137-161, (1985); Kučera, Antonín, A Logical Viewpoint on Process-algebraic Quotients, Journal of Logic and Computation, 13, 6, pp. 863-880, (2003); Merro, Massimo, Behavioral theory for Mobile Ambients, Journal of the ACM, 52, 6, pp. 961-1023, (2005); Communicating and Mobile Systems the Calculus, (1999)","S.

The consultation subject is taken in causal analysis and database design to conceive causal relation. The causal analysis is abstracted into effectiveness which is caused by requisites and prohibitions for effects. The database design is represented as recursive Backus-Naur Form for structural expressions. Then abstract consultation can be regarded as a function to transform effectiveness into recursive representation. The sense or meaning of such abstract consultation may be a semantics of conditioned formulas in modal logic. The modal logic is formulated in this paper, by extending postfix modality for name of database design as well as greatest fixed point operator for denoting an equilibrium state set where the transformation of effectiveness with prefix modality to design with postfix modality may be available. The conditioning of formulas is given by a state set so that the formula may be considered in terms of propositional base. As regards recursive representations in Backus-Naur Form for database design, model theory is established in 3-valued domain, for the sense of strong negation in accordance to prohibitions influencing effectiveness. Some fixed point is taken for the mapping associated with recursive representations, where the mapping is related to formations of models over 3-valued domain. The fixed point model can be seen as means of retrieval. However, because the mapping is generally a nonmonotonic function whose fixed point semantics is not always available, we have another method to adopt negation as failure for strong negation such that the model of a given recursive representation as database is always guaranteed if the representation takes a restricted form. Abstract consultation to effectiveness for database design is thus formulated, with model theory in database representations. © © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, one challenging problem is to prove that the transformation into the target model of computation (MoC) preserves the semantics of the original AADL model or at least some of its properties. Moreover, the AADL standard lacks a formal semantics to make the validation of this translation possible. Albeit some of the related works give informal explanations on the model transformations they apply to interpret or compile AADL, the formal proof of semantics preservation remains in most cases altogether impossible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for a synchronous subset of AADL, which includes periodic threads and data port communications. Its operational semantics is formalized as a TTS (Timed Transition System). This formalization is one prerequisite to the formal proof of semantics preservation for our model transformation from AADL sources to our target verification formalism: TASM (Timed Abstract State Machine). In this paper, an abstract syntax of (our subset of) AADL is given, together with the abstract syntax of TASM. The translation is formalized by a family of semantics functions, which associates each AADL construct to a TASM fragment. Then, the proof of simulation equivalence between the TTSs of the AADL and the TASM models is formalized and mechanized using the proof assistant Coq. © 2011 IEEE.",AADL; Operational semantics; Semantics preservation; TASM; Translational semantics,AADL; Abstract state machines; Abstract syntax; Formal proofs; Formal Semantics; Meta model; Model checker; Model transformation; Operational semantics; Proof assistant; Schedulability analysis; Target model; TASM; Timed transition systems; Translational semantics; Abstracting; Computer programming languages; Computer simulation; Model checking; Semantics; Syntactics; Formal methods,,,,,,,"Architecture Analysis Design Language Aadl, (2004); Chkouri, Mohamed Yassin, Translating AADL into BIP - Application to the verification of real-time systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5421, pp. 5-19, (2009); Sokolsky, Oleg, Schedulability analysis of AADL models, 2006, (2006); Abdoul, Thomas, AADL execution semantics transformation for formal verification, pp. 263-268, (2008); Berthomieu, Bernard, Formal verification of AADL specifications in the topcased environment, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5570 LNCS, pp. 207-221, (2009); Ölveczky, Peter Csaba, Formal semantics and analysis of behavioral AADL models in real-time Maude, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6117 LNCS, pp. 47-62, (2010); Jahier, Erwan, Virtual execution of AADL models via a translation into synchronous programs, pp. 134-143, (2007); Ma, Yue, Distributed simulation of AADL specifications in a polychronous model of computation, pp. 607-614, (2009); Tasm Language Reference Manual Version 1 1, (2006); Ouimet, Martin, The TASM toolset: Specification, simulation, and formal verification of real-time systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4590 LNCS, pp. 126-130, (2007)","Z.

To verify and analyze the AADL models, model transformation technologies are often used to automatically extract a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification. In this process, it remains a challenge to prove that the model transformation preserves the semantics of the initial AADL model or, at least, some of the specific properties or requirements it needs to satisfy. This paper presents a machine checked semantics-preserving transformation of a subset of AADL (including periodic threads, data port communications, mode changes, and the AADL behavior annex) into Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM). The AADL standard itself lacks at present a formal semantics to make this translation validation possible. Our contribution is to bridge this gap by providing two formal semantics for the subset of AADL. The execution semantics provided by the AADL standard is formalized as Timed Transition Systems (TTS). This formalization gives a reference expression of AADL semantics which can be compared with the TASM-based translation (for verification purpose).

In this paper, the use of event driven architecture (EDA) as a platform for supporting event oriented applications in power control centers is presented. EDA operates on the semantics of events and event patterns, which are easy to decipher, flexible, extensible and conform to the standard. The concept is explained with real-time congestion management procedure recently introduced in Indian power sector. The semantics of events pertaining to real-time congestion management are defined in terms of states and state transitions of an abstract state machine. The state machine is then used to define a minimal set of basic and complex event patterns, which are implemented using an open source event processing tool. The results show that the congestion state of the system is correctly identified, and can be used as decision support. The case study is indicative of a wider set of event oriented applications that can be supported by EDA at control centers and constituents.",Complex event processing (CEP); Event driven architecture (EDA); Power control centers; Real-time congestion management; State machines,Decision support systems; Semantics; Complex event processing (CEP); Congestion management; Eventdriven architecture (EDA); Power control centers; State machine; Power control,,,,,,,"Complex Event Processing, (2007); Adi, Asaf, Complex event processing for financial services, pp. 7-12, (2006); Zang, Chuanzhen, Complex event processing in enterprise information systems based on RFID, Enterprise Information Systems, 1, 1, pp. 3-23, (2007); Zang, Chuanzhen, Architecture, implementation and application of complex event processing in enterprise information systems based on RFID, Information Systems Frontiers, 10, 5, pp. 543-553, (2008); Britton, Jay P., Moving from data architecture to event architecture in the EMS environment, 3, pp. 2704-2707, (2005); Walzer, Karen, Event-driven manufacturing: Unified management of primitive and complex events for manufacturing monitoring and control, pp. 383-391, (2008); Zhao, Hongshan, Modeling and analysis of power system events, (2006); Khaparde, Shrikrishna A., Complex event processing of high level events in multi-area power grid: An Indian perspective, (2010); Kirschen, Daniel S., Intelligent Alarm Processing in Power Systems, Proceedings of the IEEE, 80, 5, pp. 663-672, (1992); Electra, (1991)",,,Power Systems Computation Conference ( PSCC ),,"17th Power Systems Computation Conference, PSCC 2011",2011-08-22 through 2011-08-26,Stockholm,113935,,9.78918E+12,,,English,"Power Syst.

It can not effectively determine the size and position of the graphic display, and it is difficult to effectively support the graphic language layout control. Therefore, this paper proposes a new automatic graphic language arrangement algorithm in visual communication design. Through the fixed value method to calculate the display size of buffer image in visual communication design, the minimum number of layout layout and the maximum surface utilization are taken as the layout objective function; the ant colony algorithm is used to solve the problem, and the optimal solution is obtained to obtain the best display position of the graphics in visual communication design. The description of graphic language is realized by syntax description based on rules and semantic description based on ASM (abstract state machine). This paper describes the parallel process and selection process of graphic language in visual communication design by using parallel and selection logo, and realizes automatic layout of graphic language by using parallel process and selection process. The algorithm is programmed and run by C language officer to achieve the purpose of automatic arrangement of graphic language. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Arrangement; Automation; Graphic language; Visual communication design,Ant colony optimization; Display devices; Intelligent systems; Semantics; Visual communication; Abstract state machines; Ant colony algorithms; Graphics languages; Objective functions; Optimal solutions; Semantic descriptions; Size and position; Visual communication designs; Visual languages,,,,,,,"Fujian Tea, (2016); Meteorol Sci Technol, (2015); Qu, Zhijian, Distribution automation primitive real time encoding storage and display technology of graph-database integration generation, Dianli Xitong Baohu yu Kongzhi/Power System Protection and Control, 44, 16, pp. 118-124, (2016); Modern Electronics Technique, (2017)","D.

However, making Trusted OS and all Trusted Applications run in the same trusted environment may cause problems - the exploitation of vulnerabilities on any component will affect the others in the system. Although ARM proposed S-EL2 virtualization technology, which supports multiple isolated partitions in the Security World to alleviate this problem, there may still be security threats such as information leakage between partitions in the actual partition manager. Current secure partition manager designs and implementations lack rigorous mathematical proofs to guarantee the security of isolated partitions. This study analyzes the multiple secure partitions architecture of ARM TrustZone in detail, proposes a refinement-based modeling and security analysis method for multiple secure partitions of TrustZone, and completes the modeling and formal verification of the secure partition manager based on the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. First, a multiple security partitions model named RMTEE is built based on refinement, an abstract state machine is used to describe the system running process and security policy requirements, and the abstract model of multiple secure partitions is established and instantiated. Then the concrete model of the secure partition manager is implemented, in which the event specification is implemented following the FF-A specification. Secondly, in view of the problem that the existing partition manager design cannot meet the goal of information flow security verification, a DAC-based inter-partition communication access control is designed and applied to the modeling and verification of TrustZone security partition manager. Finally, the correctness of the concrete model's refinement of the abstract model and the correctness and security of the event specification in the concrete model are proved, thus completing the formal proof of 137 definitions and 201 lemmas in the model (more than 11,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code). The results show that the model satisfies confidentiality and integrity, and can effectively defend against malicious attacks of partitions. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, verifying the effectiveness of secure cache designs introduces numerous challenges. The assessment of cache architecture security in prior research has mainly been based on the evaluators' expertise, which lacks convincing evidence. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a universal and comprehensive formal verification methodology to evaluate the security of cache designs. This paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of an existing formal verification method. Based on this analysis, we introduce an enhanced formal verification method that utilizes noninterference hyperproperties to verify the security of cache architectures.In this paper, an extended triple mutual information formula is utilized to verify the satisfaction of noninterference hyperproperties within cache architectures and identify potential information leakages through three independence conditions. The degree of information leakage is evaluated by measuring the dependencies between the victim's inputs and the attacker's observations through triple mutual information. This paper instantiates existing cache architectures and reveals potential vulnerabilities by formalizing the behavior specification and replacement policy of a cache as an extended abstract state machine. Lastly, the cache security structure is formally validated utilizing the proposed security model, with the aim of evidencing its effectiveness and soundness. © 2024 IEEE.",Cache side-channel; Formal verification method; Noninterference hyperproperties; Triple mutual information,Computer architecture; Network security; Side channel attack; Cache architecture; Cache design; Cache side-channel; Formal verification methods; Information leakage; Mutual informations; Noninterference hyperproperty; Side-channel; Triple mutual information; Verification methodology; Formal verification,,,,,,,"Jahl, Christian, The information technology security evaluation criteria, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 306-312, (1991); Lou, Xiaoxuan, A Survey of Microarchitectural Side-channel Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defenses in Cryptography, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 6, (2022); Osvik, Dag Arne, Cache attacks and counter-measures: The case of AES, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3960 LNCS, pp. 1-20, (2006); Liu, Yuxin, Analysis of DRAM Vulnerability Using Computation Tree Logic, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, 2022-May, pp. 986-991, (2022); Goguen, Joseph A., Security Policies and Security Models, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1982-July, 1982, pp. 11-20, (2012); Zhang, Tianwei, New models of cache architectures characterizing information leakage from cache side channels, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 2014-December, December, pp. 96-105, (2014); Cache Timing Attacks on AES, (2005); Song, Wei, Randomized last-level caches are still vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks!

These techniques are significant for design, reasoning and standardization of programming languages, and for design and optimization of compiler as well. They have been widely used in formal description, analysis, verification and design of security protocols. In sharp contrast to the popularity of formal syntax, formal semantic descriptions have seldom been exploited in practical applications concerning design and implementation of programming languages. In this paper, we firstly review the history of development for semantic description frameworks of programming languages. Then we illustrate and assess the features of main frameworks of current interest. Finally, we give the qualitative comparisons of these frameworks distinctly.

As these tasks do not depend on the latest updates by transactions, it is assumed that the data required by OLAP systems are kept in a data warehouse, which separates the input from operational databases from the outputs to OLAP. However, user requirements for OLAP systems change over time. Data warehouses and OLAP systems thus are rather dynamic and the design process is continuous. In order to easily incorporate new requirements and at the same time ensure the quality of the system design, we suggest to apply the Abstract State Machine (ASM) based development method. This assumes we capture the basic user requirements in a ground model and then apply stepwise refinements to the ground model for every design decisions or further new requirements. In this article, we show that a systematical approach which is tailored for data warehouse design with a set of formal refinement rules can simplify the work in dynamic data warehouse design and at the same time improves the quality of the system. © J.UCS.",Abstract state machine; Data warehouse; On-Line Analytical processing; Refinement,,,,,,,,"B Book Assigning Programs to Meanings, (1996); Formal Methods and Tools for Computer Science Eurocast 2001, (2001); Blaschka, Markus, On schema evolution in multidimensional databases, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1676, pp. 153-164, (1999); Blass, Andreas R., Abstract State Machines Capture Parallel Algorithms, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 4, 4, pp. 578-651, (2003); Börger, Egon, The ASM ground model method as a foundation of requirements engineering, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2772, pp. 145-160, (2004); Börger, Egon, The ASM Refinement Method, Formal Aspects of Computing, 15, 2-3, pp. 237-257, (2003); Evolving Algebras Mini Course, (1995); Abstract State Machines A Method for High Level System Design and Analysis, (2003); Bouzeghoub, Mokrane, A logical model for data warehouse design and evolution, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1874, pp. 178-188, (2000); Gupta, Ashish, Adapting Materialized Views after Redefinitions, SIGMOD Record, 24, 2, pp. 211-222, (1995)","J.

Therefore, unlike the definition for SDL-2000, we define the static semantics of SDL based on functions and predicates, which indirectly represent a syntax tree. The definitions according to this approach are shown to be more precise and readable. Especially, this approach can be fulfilled by doing a little modification on the current definition.

To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. For requirements development, especially requirements validation and verification, model-driven architecture techniques can be considered as a cost-efficient solution. In order to utilize such advantages, the design of the proposed system is often specified in terms of analyzable models at the certain level of abstraction. Further, different levels of requirements are translated into verifiable queries and fed into the models to be either validated or verified. For requirements management, requirements traceability provides critical support for performing change impact analysis, risk analysis, regression testing, etc. In this thesis, we cover several topics about requirements validation, requirements verification, and requirements traceability. In particular, the technical contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose an approach to requirements validation by using the extended Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined TASM constructs and, 2) we present a simulation-based method which is powered up by statistical techniques to conduct requirements verification, working with industrial applications and, 3) we introduce an improved VSM-based requirements traceability recovery approach using a novel context analysis.

Many programming languages allow some non-determinism for evaluating expressions. The semantics only have in common that arguments are evaluated before an operator is applied. The evaluation of one argument may be interleaved with the evaluation of the other arguments. However, programming languages usually restrict this most liberal evaluation order.

Instead they compile into programs of an abstract machine which ignores limitations and properties of real-life processors, (ii) the code generated by correct compilers is orders of magnitudes slower than the code generated by unverified compilers, (iii) the considered source language is much less complex than real-life programming languages. This paper focuses on the construction of correct compiler back-ends which generate machine-code for real-life processors from realistic intermediate languages. Our main results are the following: (i) We present a proof approach based on abstract state machines for bottom-up rewriting system specifications (BURS) for back-end generators. A significant part of this proof can be parametrized with the intermediate and machine language, (ii) The performance of the code constructed by our approach is in the same order of magnitude as the code generated by non-optimizing unverified C-compilers. © Springer Pub.

Following this idea, in this paper, we propose an approach for incrementally verifying the dynamic semantics specified with abstract state machines (ASMs), such that definitions of previous versions must not be altered in subsequent versions. As a result, the compiler can be verified incrementally without revising the proofs of previous versions. As our first step, in this paper, we formalize and verify the memory mapping of the initial versions with ASMs and discuss their extensibility for the next increments.

Various e-science and e-business use cases are investigated to guide how to create grid systems, and determine which functions grid systems should have. Web services emerge as a standard interoperable technology for grid systems. Although the motivations and goals for service grids are obvious, there is no clear definition for service grids to define and describe the general framework and service access model. In this paper, the general framework for service grids is defined in a formal approach, and the virtual organization based service access mechanism is modeled based on Abstract State Machines (ASM). In the service access model we proposed, the Quality of Service (QoS) issue is considered for the user request.

The attack scenarios or security requirements in some of these IDSs are specified in attack specification languages that are different from software specification languages. The use of two different languages for software specification and attack specification may generate redundant and conflicting requirements. The advantage of using the same language for both functional specifications and attacks specifications is that software designers can address the two different issues without learning two types of languages. We present a method of integrating Abstract State Machine Language (AsmL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) state charts that are extended finite state machine based software specification languages, with an open source IDS Snort. This work provides AsmL and UML users an IDS that they can use without knowing how to write Snort rules. We automatically translate attack scenarios written in AsmL and UML state charts into Snort rules with context information. The original Snort is modified so that it can use the rules automatically generated by the translator. Adding context information to Snort rules improves the detection capability of Snort. To show the efficacy of the presented approach, we have built a prototype and evaluated it using a number of well-known attack scenarios. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",Attack scenarios; Intrusion detection; Software specification languages; State machines,Computer crime; Computer privacy; Computer programming languages; Intrusion detection; Security of data; Unified Modeling Language; Abstract State Machine Language; Software specification languages; State machines; Computer software,,,,,,,"Technical Report, (1980); Proc of 2nd International Workshop on Scenarios and State Machines Models Algorithms and Tools, (2003); Proceedings of the 1st European Conference on Model Driven Software Engineering, (2003); Cheng, Kwang Ting Tim, Automatic generation of functionial vectors using the extended finite state machine model, ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems, 1, 1, pp. 57-79, (1996); McDermott, John P., Using abuse case models for security requirements analysis, Proceedings - Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, ACSAC, Part F133431, pp. 55-64, (1999); Proc Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, (2001); Eckmann, Steven T., STATL: An attack language for state-based intrusion detection, Journal of Computer Security, 10, 1-2, pp. 71-103, (2002); Giffin, Jonathon T., Efficient Context-Sensitive Intrusion Detection, (2004); Graves, Mathews, Bridging the Gap: Software Specification Meets Intrusion Detector, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2006); Grieskamp, Wolfgang, Testable use cases in the Abstract State Machine Language, pp. 167-172, (2001)","M.U.A.

However, compared to the testing of functional requirements, these techniques are not prevalent that much in testing software security. This paper presents a model-based approach to automatic testing of attack scenarios. An attack testing framework is proposed to model attack scenarios and test the system with respect to the modeled attack scenarios. The techniques adopted in the framework are applicable in general to the systems, where the potential attack scenarios can be modeled in a formalism based on extended abstract state machines. The attack events, i.e., attack test vectors chosen from the attacks happening in real-world are converted to the test driver specific events ready to be tested against the attack signatures. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the most common attack scenarios. The framework is useful to test software with respect to potential attacks which can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,Attack scenarios; Attack signature; Extended abstracts; Functional requirement; Model based approach; Model based testing; Model-based; Potential attack; Quality software; Real-world; Security vulnerabilities; Test drivers; Test vectors; Testing framework; Testing software; Automatic testing; Risk perception; Security of data; Computer software,,,,,,,"Dalal, Siddhartha R., Model-based testing in practice, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 285-294, (1999); Rosaria, S., Applying models in your testing process, Information and Software Technology, 42, 12, pp. 815-824, (2000); Chandramouli, Ramaswamy, Automated testing of security functions using a combined model & interface-driven approach, Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science, 37, pp. 4779-4788, (2004); Proc of the 14th International Software and Internet Quality Week Conference, (2001); Proc of the 18th Computer Security Applications Conference, (2002); Barnett, Mike, Towards a tool environment for model-based testing with AsmL, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2931, pp. 252-266, (2004); Darpa Intrusion Detection Evaluation; Barnett, Mike, The ABCs of specification: Asml, behavior, and components, Informatica (Slovenia), 25, 4, pp. 517-526, (2001); Raihan, Mohammad Feroz, AsmLSec: An extension of abstract state machine language for attack scenario specification, pp. 775-782, (2007); Potter, Bruce, Software security testing, IEEE Security and Privacy, 2, 5, pp. 81-85, (2004)","M.
